0,Nicki Minaj,Hip Hop/Rap,18,Chun-Li,"Ayo, look like I'm goin' for a swim
Dunk on 'em, now I'm swingin' off the rim
Bitch ain't comin' off the bench
While I'm comin' off the court fully drenched
Here, get some haterade, get ya thirst quenched
Styled on 'em in this Burberry trench
These birds copy every word, every inch
But gang gang got the hammer and the wrench (brrr)
I pull up in that quarter milli off the lot
Oh, now she tryna be friends like I forgot
Show off my diamonds like I'm signed by the Roc
Ain't pushin' out his babies 'til he buy the rock

Ayo, I been on, bitch, you been conned
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on

He keep on dialin' Nicki like the Prince song
I-I-I been on, bitch, you been conned
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on
Ayo, I been off, Lara been Croft
Plates say Chun-Li, drop the Benz off

Oh, I get it, they paintin' me out to be the bad guy
Well when's the last time you see a bad guy do the rap game like me?

I went and copped the chopsticks
Put it in my bun just to pop shit
I'm always in the top shit
Box seats, bitch, fuck the gossip
How many of them coulda did it with finesse?
Now everybody like, ""She really is the best.""
You play checkers, couldn't beat me playin' chess
Now I'm about to turn around and beat my chest
Bitch, it's King Kong, yes, it's King Kong
Bitch, it's King Kong, this is King Kong
Chinese ink on, Siamese links on
Call me 2 Chainz, name go ding dong
Bitch, it's King Kong, yes, I'm King Kong
This is King Kong? Yes, Miss King Kong
In my kingdom wit my Timbs on
How many championships? What? Six rings on

They need rappers like me, they need rappers like me
So they can get on their fucking keyboards and make me the bad guy, Chun-Li

Ayo, I been on, bitch, you been conned
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on
I mean I been Storm, X-Men been formed
He keep on dialin' Nicki like the Prince song

Chu wan me to leave then take it d-down
You see me come out of England at dawn
You say the pattern come from Kingston
Trinidad Trinidad, my island

I see you in here dancin'
Your preview is quite romantic
I envy your perfect kind of life
Who knew you'd be so sexy
I think you're quite fantastic
Screw your flaws
You're perfect in my eyes

And maybe I'm naive for loving you
You're a cheat and a liar
But tonight you're everything I desire
You beautiful sinner
I love your wicked heart
Beautiful sinner
It's such a work of art

I didn't know that bad could love so good
You are the type of bad that feels so good

Beautiful sinner

I think you're hard as stone
Living in your world alone
I hope you let me in tonight
They want me to beware
You're dangerous but I don't care
I can't wait to have you in my arms

And maybe I'm naive for loving you
You're a cheat and a liar
But tonight you're everything I desire

4,Nicki Minaj,Hip Hop/Rap,18,Up In Flames,"We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher

Anyway lil' nigga don't test the kid
Even Maury Povich couldn't test the kid
Even R. Kelly couldn't touch the kid
And even with all your bars you couldn't text the kid
I got a pool that I never even swam in
Airports that you bitches never land in
They be like what you doing Nicki brandin'
Suck a cockpit, prepare for landin'
I'm brandin', I ain't talking about Press B
I keep a sniper, I ain't talking about Wesley
Why these bitches so pressed B
Open my trunk, all I gotta do is press B
Imma violate your asses like Chris Stokes
I'm on St. Troupez on a big boat
Go my way to make my billi like a big goat
Pull my dick out in case you bitches get a slick throat

We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher

Ru-ru-ru-runnin' in around, never get the rev
Got the clothing line poppin' and the wigs is next
When I fly you know G5 is the jet
I'm the motherfuckin' Queen, 'lizabeth
Meetings with the president of every network
That is what the fuck I call how to network
My net worth, that net works
Keep my shooters out in Brooklyn where the nets work
Chillin' with executives
Check the charts, all my winnings are consecutive
Trillion dollar deficit
But y'all don't hear me though, all you bitches deaf as shit
B-B-Bitches ain't go punchlines or flow
I have both and an empire also
Sell out shows out in Norway, Oslo
This is the Re-Up better cop it while it costs low
F-F-Flows sick, I-I-I'll slap a patient
I'm checkin' these bitches like an application
Cause these bitches trip on no navigation
So it's off with your head, decapitation
S-S-Send 'em up in flames like a firemen
I do the hirin' and I do the firin'
That boss shit that you talk, I live it
And I'm callin' a travel if you don't stay on your pivot
Bitches

We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher"
6,Nicki Minaj,Hip Hop/Rap,18,Young Forever,"I used to think that we'd run away
One lovely pretty summer day
I remember when you would say
""We'd be okay, come with me.""

I never knew you would lie to me
Take everything from inside of me
Your silhouette in the doorway
But before you walk away

Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy you'll be young forever

I'll be over here, you'll be over there
I'ma shed a tear but I really don't care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy you'll be young forever

I used to think that we'd reunite
I'd be your wife, in the real life
I thought that you'd come back for me
And you would take me away

I never knew only as a teen
You'd reappear, only in my dream
Your silhouette in the doorway
But before you walk away

Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy you'll be young forever

I'll be over here, you'll be over there
I'ma shed a tear but I really don't care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy you'll be young forever

This is my last cry
Is this the only way?
This is my own prison
I'm frozen in time, in time, in time

Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy you'll be young forever

I'll be over here, you'll be over there
Wanna shed a tear but I really don't care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy you'll be young forever

You'll always be mine, frozen in time
Young forever (young forever)"

To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
Even though I said don't touch me I lied, I lied
I can't fall for you, can't give my all to you
I can't let you think that Imma let the game stall for you
Gotta protect me you gotta sweat me
You said you thought you was ready and I said let's see
But I ain't mean that, I need some fucking proof
'Cause what happens if I fall in love then you cut me loose
You just a heart breaker won't let you break mine
'Cause I'll be smashing windows and cutting them break lines

I lied
'Cause who knew if I should let myself go with you
Who knows, who knows, so I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

Even though I said fuck you, I lied, I lied
I thought eventually you would let me go
That was my insecurities and my ego
Missed my jump shot missed my free throw
Miss the way we kiss miss the d o
Man it was good while it lasted
That shit wasn't real it was magic
If it was a record it would have been classic
But fuck you though, orgasmic

This is what I gotta do to keep me from falling
Stalling the truth, who knew what you'd
Do If I let you in
My mama ain't raised no fool
I am not your usual typical type
Who would protect me if I never hide?
Falling so fast I am afraid of you

So I lied, I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
I lied, ooh baby, ooh
'Cause what if I let myself go with you"

I swear sometimes I feel like it nurtures me
But to keep it all real is kinda hurtin' me
I could say I'm done with it, but it lurks in me

So Imma just tell myself that it works for me
Take a real long drive in the Mer-ce-des
And I might pop a couple of them per-co-cets
Yeah that'll make me transform to Hercules

Here I am, here I am, so tell me, 'cause I am
Here I am, here I am, so tell me, 'cause I am
Here I am, here I am, so tell me, 'cause I am

I swear to God, man, everything in life is old
And the only thing that change is the price of gold
Even in the afterlife Imma fight your soul
'Cause the second time around I'll be twice as grown

So do you take me to be who I am?
To have and to hold till death do us part
'Cause if not it's just best we both part
'Cause how am I supposed to finish what you start?

You got me thinkin' twice to just breathe
Then you say I won't survive if I leave
But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve
I no longer need your attention, at ease

It's a joke, it's a game,
Why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar

It's a joke, it's a game,
Why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar

It's a joke, it's a game,
Why am I still keeping score?

Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym,
And he keep a du-rag, keep the wave on swim;
Wa-wa-waves on swim, so they hate on him...

Anyway, I think I met him sometime before,
In a different life, or where I record...
I mean... he was Adam, I think I was Eve,
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree...

S-S-S on my chest, 'cause I'm ready to save him,
Ready to get buck on anybody that plays him...
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him;
When he call me ""Mama"", ""Lil' Mama"", I call him ""Baby""...

When I was a geisha, he was a samurai...
Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai;
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly...

S-S-S on my chest, let me get my cape on;
He's so thugged out, Ghostface and Raekwon...

Hit 'em with the oh now that's just ridiculous
We could've kid up all these particulars
That could have been the homicide vehicular
You wasn't in to no state to speed off
You was buggin out, ya you was p'd off
We was just chilling up at the ski loft
Thinkin' we was on, you telling me we off
Your whole vibe changed when you got the phone call
That's the affect they call a snow ball,
Next thing you know I was running down the hall,
Saying, ""Please come back, I have given my all.""
I have given my all
Funny how you could always make me feel small
I have given my all

Catch me, catch me, I think I'm gonna fall

I'm waiting on you, waiting, boy
My mind is set, I'm waiting on you
I'm waiting for you, waiting boy
Could you catch me, could you catch me,
Could you catch me?
I am waiting on you to catch me

You want it, oh, so bad to prove points
But your game always makes me lose points
And your game always makes me concur
That maybe I should have never taken you from her
But with all of the aforementioned
I am still trapped in your dimension
So I will be on the mountain waiting
'Cause I am in need of more attention
Could've called back, just to say some
I'ma fall back, in the bass drum
Please come to, destination
I'm not doing well, exclamation
You succeeded at your attempts to make me
Need you desperately, to vindicate me
It's funny how you could always make me feel small
I have given my all

Catch me, catch me, I think I'm gonna fall
My mind is made up, I'm waiting for you
I'm waiting on you, waiting, boy
My mind is set, I'm waiting on you
I'm waiting for you, waiting, boy
Could you catch me, could you catch me,
Could you catch me?
I am waiting on you to catch me

Oh, oh, OK, oh, oh, OK, oh, oh, OK
It's whatever you say,
Eh, eh,
It's whatever you say,
Eh, eh,

My mind is made up, I'm waiting for you
I'm waiting on you, waiting, boy
My mind is set, I'm waiting on you,

I tried to channel you in hopes that I could stare you back
But it's like every intersection we just missed each other
You got your fans waiting, tell me you ain't six feet under
And tell that you coming back and you just took a break
Maybe I blamed you for everything - that was my mistake
In hindsight, I loved your rawness and I loved your edge
'Cause it was you who talked me down from jumping off the ledge
Your earrings bamboo
Your long nails, too
Your BMW
Every time you came through
You was the brave heart
You stole Wayne heart
You never switched it up
You played the same part
But I needed to grow
And I needed to know
Were there some things inside of me that I needed to show?
So I just deaded you
Left you in all black
But dear, old Nicki
Please call back

You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly I believed you
But I'm standing here calling
I can't see you
But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that

Yo, did I chase the glitz and glamour?
Money, fame and power?
'Cause if so that will forever go down my lamest hour
I should've kept you with me, gettin' at them nameless cowards
There was no match for you
Couldn't defeat your prowess
I had to make them changes - I hope you understood
You see for every bad, I did a ton of good
But you was underground and I was mainstream
I live the life now, that we would daydream
My only wish is you come enjoy it with me
Get on them conference calls
Go meet them lawyers with me
The money came, yeah
Tripled and quadrupled it
But I still miss us when we was just on some stupid shit
And it still fucked the media
They ridiculed you
Never believed in ya
They just deaded you
Left you in all black
But dear, old Nicki
Please call back

You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly I believed you
But I'm standing here calling
I can't see you
But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that

26,Nicki Minaj,Hip Hop/Rap,18,All Things Go,"Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in vent
I put the heat in vents, man I been competin' since
I look beyond what people sayin', and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher, what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there will never be a sequel
And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful
As long as 7 years from now, I'm taking my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was o' six
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I look down, yes I suppose

All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel a minute, yeah we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment till it falls
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'm a ride I'm with you still the night is young
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go
We wake back up and do it all again
We know, we know, say fuck the world, we ridin' till the end
I know it's sudden, look at what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it for you

I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence
His sister said, he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?
'Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know, that I love him
Family ties, broken before me, niggas tryna kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me, yes I get it, I get it, it was all me
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes, the last day he saw me

All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel a minute, yeah we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment till it falls
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'm a ride I'm with you still the night is young
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go
We wake back up and do it all again
We know, we know, say fuck the world, we ridin' till the end
I know it's sudden, look at what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it for you

Let me make this clear I'm not difficult, I'm just about my business
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself, and that's a fact
I'd give it all, if somehow, I could just rekindle that
She never understands, why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like, somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say ""We did it!""
My child with Aaron, would've been sixteen, any minute
So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah, is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him
And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Yeah we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writing, this is the Pinkprint

All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go"

You niggas is Kevin Hart, y'all be acting funny
I'mma a keep a linebacker, tell 'em tackle for me
Yo, you seen my last pic, go double-tap that for me
Cock back, Red octagon, stop that

Plenty more for you, boy
We in the funky four door, no floor
He was serving that raw, oh boy
She was making that noise, oh boy"
37,Nicki Minaj,Hip Hop/Rap,18,The Crying Game,"Here we go again, it's the game we love
Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs
You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade, in your face, and shrugged
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just planning a wedding, caucasian doves
You was just tellin' your man's, that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs

Are you alone?
Do you need someone?
And is it too late to talk?
Did I wait too long?
Thousand words don't change a thing
Is it only three?
Three words that you're missing?

Where did you go?
Couldn't see
I was too busy
Couldn't've just said no
Where would you go?
I think I know

Ooh, ooh, we're back to playing,
We're back to playing.
Ooh, ooh, we're back to playing,
The crying game.

I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing
The crying game

I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing
The crying game

Welcome to the crying game where you lose your soul
Where it ain't no easy cash, you got to use the toll
Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control
Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes
Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?
Another slap to the face, another uppercut
I'm just abusive by nature, not 'cause I hate ya
Not 'cause I wanna, guess I wanna imitate ya
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya
But is you stayin' or goin'?
I couldn't breathe and you ain't even know it
How come you never show it?
All this love you speak of
All I want is to love and to be loved
(To love and to be loved)

I'm losin' a thing I thought I'd win
And I'm coming undone
'Cause the tears don't end

Where did you go?
Couldn't see
I was too busy
Couldn't've just said no
Where would you go?
I think I know

Ooh, ooh, we're back to playing,
We're back to playing.
Ooh, ooh, we're back to playing,
The crying game.

I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing,

Why these niggas going broke to get ya approval?
Pretty soon, they'll be back up on dem Ramen noodles

See you told me I would lose but I won
I might cop a million Jimmy Choos just for fun
'Cause bitches couldn't take what was in me
Australia, Sydney, might run up in Disney
Out in LA with Lindsey

Got the eye of the tiger, the lion of Judah
Now it's me in my time, it's just me in my prime
Everything I tried to teach 'em, they gon' see it in time

Makiah and Jelani why I grind like I do

Now the whole album crack, you ain't gotta skip a track
I ain't gotta get a plaque, I ain't gotta get awards
I just walk up out the door, all the girls will applaud

All the girls will come in, as long as they understand
That I'm fightin' for the girls that never thought they could win
'Cause before they could begin you told 'em it was the end
But I am here to reverse the curse that they live in

Got two bones to pick, I'ma only choose one
You might get addressed on the second album

Don't make it too easy, girl, don't take it too fast
Yeah, that's it right there, that's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still wet 'cause you just took a shower
Runnin' on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard
Knowin' you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool
Couple things due but you always get it done
Might have been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away and you'll always be the one
One, I wonder why the moon look nice, girl
Maybe it's just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in their life as a wife
That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest
Why you want to fight for your right
'Cause you don't love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise

I know things get hard, but girl, you got it, girl, you got it, there you go
Can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
It's just amazing, girl, and all I can say is
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you

All of them bitches I'm badder than
Mansions in Malibu, Babylon
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when I'm straddlin'
And my shit's so wet you gotta paddle in
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row ya boat
It's Pink Friday Records and OVO
Done did the pop tour, I'm the realest still
The best legal team so the deals is ill
It's MAC, OPI, and a fragrance too
Apparel, I'm dominating every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
'Cause I'm fl-fl-fly I'm flying high
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch

But baby, if you ask me to take a break
I'll give it all away, don't care what the people say
I'll be a million, billion, trillion miles away

He asked my sign, I said a Sag'
I'm a star, sheriff badge
What's the point if I'm guarding?
Double D up, hoes, Dolly Parton

I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you

He the type to pop tags, and be cockin' the brim;
Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym,
And he keep a du-rag, keep the wave on swim;
Wa-wa-waves on swim, so they hate on him...

Anyway, I think I met him sometime before,
In a different life, or where I record...
I mean... he was Adam, I think I was Eve,
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree...

S-S-S on my chest, 'cause I'm ready to save him,
Ready to get buck on anybody that plays him...
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him;
When he call me ""Mama"", ""Lil' Mama"", I call him ""Baby""...

Just left Money Gram in the Lemon Lam...
Hot damn, make me scream like Summer Jam;
I mean, that nigga must be from the motherland...

Anyway, I think I met him in the sky;
When I was a geisha, he was a samurai...
Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai;
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly...

S-S-S on my chest, let me get my cape on;
He's so thugged out, Ghostface and Raekwon...
Konvict! Just like Akon,

Do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes
They only pretend, you will be mine
And you know how you made me, believe
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved
But do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

Nicki Minaj
You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud, but I'mma remain icon-stat
Balenciaga's on my boots with the python strap
You was caught up in the rush, and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before, I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, man you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'
'Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating
Overdosin', no more postin', no more toastin' over oceans
They say you don't know what you got till it's gone
They say that your darkest hour comes before your dawn
But there was something I should've asked all along
I'mma ask on the song

Skylar Grey
Do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes

And you know how you made me, believe
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved
But do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

Nicki Minaj
I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down it's like you ain't even notice em
If you had a heart, I was hoping you would've showed it some
What the fuck you really telling me, what you telling me
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't want to catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy
They say you don't know what you got till it's gone
They said that your darkest hour came before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along
I'mma ask on the song

Skylar Grey
So does she know I've been in that bed before
A thousand count, and not a single threaded truth
If I was just another girl
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So call me, when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself

Skylar Grey
Do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes
They only pretend, you will be mine
And you know how you made me, believe
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved
But do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies"

Somebody had it on lockdown
The moral of the story not to speak on that
She on the team, shorty mine now
And we don't ever ever ever make love
And we don't ever ever ever say ""love""
Unless I'm all up in it, she tellin' me she love that
D on that, I don't ever say uh
Bad bitch, ain't nothin' made up

Rahmeek, I'mma have to tell the truth if I speak
Unless you want to play, you ain't say this the other day
You said you was in love, and I still didn't budge
'Cause I already seen how you be going in when you be in them clubs
(I'm not even sure if this is right but, it feels good)
I could tell you was analyzing me, I could tell you was criticizing me
I could tell you was fantasizing that you would come
Slide in me and confide in me
He could tell that I was wifey material
He was liking my style in my videos
I wasn't looking for love I was looking for a buzz
So at times I would lie and say I'm busy, yo
'Cause it's too much, and it's too clutch
Who wants rumors of the two of us
But when you're away I can't get you out of my mind
But what if I met the one and your wasting your time
But you waited

Anybody? Anybody?

Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

But do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud, but I'mma remain icon-stat
Balenciaga's on my boots with the python strap
You was caught up in the rush, and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before, I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, man you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'
'Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating
Overdosin', no more postin', no more toastin' over oceans
They say you don't know what you got till it's gone
They say that your darkest hour comes before your dawn
But there was something I should've asked all along
I'mma ask on the song

I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down it's like you ain't even notice em
If you had a heart, I was hoping you would've showed it some
What the fuck you really telling me, what you telling me
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't want to catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy
They say you don't know what you got till it's gone
They said that your darkest hour came before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along
I'mma ask on the song

Skylar Grey
So does she know I've been in that bed before
A thousand count, and not a single threaded truth
If I was just another girl
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So call me, when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself

Hut-hut one, hut-hut two
Big titties, big butt too
Fuck with them real niggas
Who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is
Ring finger where the rock is
Deez hoes couldn't test me
Even if their name was Pop Quiz

Bad bitches who I fuck with
Mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens

I piss greatness, like goldish yellow
All my goons, so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove; the holy Mecca

Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she wave
They bet not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mother's instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin

I'm talkin' 'bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, messed up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga, I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the B out, behavior, my nigga

I just pulled up on Solana show, the girl's a natural
I knew her way back when Hollywood was international
Yeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends
Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz
Very presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential
I broke spirits that I never meant to
My body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine
And sleep at the opposite times
Promise shit is gettin' outta line like when you make a stencil

Closed off but I could never stay closed
Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sure?os
Black excellence, but I guess when it comes to me it's not the same though, all goodie
That just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't

210,Drake,Hip Hop/Rap,18,Teenage Fever,"Your heart is hard to carry after dark
You're to blame for what we could have been
'Cause look at what we are
Your friends are scared to tell you went too far
Funny that it's always been all about you from the start
I met someone new last night and we kicked it
And I'm going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, this time
Going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

Out of body
That's just how I feel when I'm around you, shawty
Last night we didn't say it
But girl, we both thought it
Why second guess? I should have stayed
You say the word, I'm on the way
This shit feels like teenage fever
I'm not scared of it, she ain't either
Why second guess? I should have stayed
'Cause you know what's on my mind tonight

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

Yeah, slightly took a left turn there
But very much 6 AM
Slightly been awake for 24 hours, so please forgive me
More ideas and stuff comin'
Yeah, yeah, fam
I'm wafflin', but man is tired, fam, Jesus Christ"
211,Drake,Hip Hop/Rap,18,Best I Ever Had,"You know alot of girls be
Thinkin' my songs are about them, but
This is not to get confused
This one's for you

Baby, you my everything
You all I ever wanted
We could do it real big
Bigger than you ever done it
You'll be up on everything
Other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever
I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down
Every time I hit her up
When I get right
I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it
Till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time

I say you the fuckin' best

You the best I ever had
Best I ever had

Call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat
You know I'll be over there
(Yup!) I'll be over there
Shorty, I'll be over there
I'll be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we can share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants hair tied chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
You ain't bringin' Drake along
You know that I'm workin'
I'll be there as soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waitin' room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused wit cause

Baby, you my everything

We could do it real big
Bigger than you ever done it
You'll be up on everything

You the best I ever had
Best I ever had
Best I ever had
Best I ever had
I say you the fuckin'...

Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for their sister
Magazine, paper girl, but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me 'the referee' 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jackpot
I'm sayin'

Baby, you my everything
You all I ever wanted
We could do it real big
Bigger than you ever done it
You'll be up on everything
Other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever

Uh
Oh yeah
See this the type of joint you got to dedicate to somebody
Just make sure they that special somebody
Young money
Yeah, yeah

You know who you are...
I got you"
212,Drake,Hip Hop/Rap,18,Do Not Disturb,"Yeah, stylin' though
Dissin', but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin' dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry yute when I was writin' Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I'll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin' the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin' up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep till morning on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assure that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up to a club 'less we doin' bis'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I Told You that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary
More Life"

Signs of the times

Playin' it right, playin' it perfect
Laughin' it off but I know you're hurtin'
Signs of the times
I say all the time
Taking my time just gets harder to find it
But you're playin' it right, you're playin' me perfect

She tryna take it all off for me

Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more

You and me we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages on your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if your rollin' backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love

You said something about a cold drink?
I don't know, I'm delirious...

Cups of the Rose, bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home, I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinking so much that imma call her anyway and say

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around

I'm just saying you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just saying you could do better
And I'll start hating only if you make me

Uh, cups of the XO, all my people been here
I see all of her friends here guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning, what you doing that's so important?

I don't think I'm conscious of making
Monsters outta the women I sponsor till it all goes bad, but shit, it's all good

We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling 'cause they were just leaving
Talk to me please don't have much to believe in

I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same

I've had sex four times this week: I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy, girl
I'm lucky that you picked up, lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on, ""Well I'm sorry.""

Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just saying you could do better

Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they wish it could've been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven
Tryna satisfy everybody
It's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough
And then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'

Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'

Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, forreal

Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up
The 6 ain't friendly but it's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, chef, curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man we really with the shits, boy
Really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy 'cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that ""Drake you gotta chill"" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like ""Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest""
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga

Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit

The other night, Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, forreal

Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up"
236,Drake,Hip Hop/Rap,18,Star67,"That's what they doin', camera on, they actin' like these singers, man. I ain't goin' to the studio until I got a situation. A subject, I need a beat, I need the producer. Who gonna be on the hook? Man, what is you doin'? Go in the studio with fuckin' clips, clips, ammo!

Brand new Beretta, can't wait to let it go
Walk up in my label like, where the check though?
Yeah, I said it, wouldn't dap you with the left ho
Shut the fuck up, text from a centerfold, I ain't reply
Let her know I read it though
Voice mail say she ready though
Niggas know I'm credible, ain't no pussy on a pedestal
Got my foot on the 'cedes Benz pedal
Doin' 90 on the bridge like, ""nigga you already know""
And if you don't know, then now you know, now you know
Switchin' up the angles
Now I'm in the Rolls with illuminated angel
Four or five chains made of gold gettin' tangled
My nigga Biz said, ""the first mill gon' change you""
Change for the better, hit it then dead her
That's my vendetta, keep this shit together
Goddamn, we ain't even gotta scam
Cocaine coupe, we ain't even got a scale
Used to flip apps, now that old plug murked
Ain't a damn thing changed, you can still get the work

Just hold on one moment and someone will be right with you
(We're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service)

Yeah, I remember how I went to Louis V with Haf'
Watched them spread ten thousand dollars on the glass
I never ever thought I'd see that in my life
Now I'm in the East cause my boys are gettin' right, man
I was on TV makin' fifty racks a year
After helpin' mama out the shit would disappear
I am not a man, I can't do this on my own
So I started askin' them if they would put me on
And they did put me on, yeah, they did put me on
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone, line
Line blowin' up, workin' on the phones
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phones
But I just couldn't do it, had to leave that shit alone, man

Hear what?
Yo hear what, tek time
(Laughing) Ah, nuh shake
Yo hear what?
Wa gwan tek Gill
Him fried, him fried and a sleep awhile ago inna di van
You know Drizzy

Blowin' up, line blowin' up, they need the whole thing
Blowin' up, my niggas really need the whole thing
Blowin' up, line blowin' up, they need the whole thing
Blowin' up, my niggas really need the whole thing

I do better with the rider in my system
Oh yeah, I'm on deck, when you call me I'll listen
I listen unless I been mixin', you know when I'm mixin'
You know when I'm mixin', I smoke when I drink, it's tradition
Like Zoe mama I go hippy
Peace sign in the air like I'm Nixon
I'm mixin', I am not Esco, but it was written
I knew when they didn't, I been had these visions
Of the life I'm livin' since I was Jimmy
All I had to do was just go and get it, and now we...

Blowin' up, line blowin' up, they need the whole thing
Blowin' up, my niggas really need the whole thing"
237,Drake,Hip Hop/Rap,18,Karaoke,"Things have been so crazy and hectic
I should have gotten back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
It's probably better anyhow

So if you gotta go
If there's anything I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you're looking for a purpose

You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore
I remember when you thought I was joking

Now I'm all singing karaoke
Further than I've ever been
So if you gotta go
If there's any way I can help

Isn't it ironic that the girl I wanna marry is a wedding planner
That tells 'em my life is too much and moves to Atlanta
Damn, of all the places you could go
I just thought you'd choose somewhere that has somebody that you know

I always up too late I worry 'bout you there alone
In that place you call your home
Warm nights and cold patron
I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy
'Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories 'bout his lady

I know they say the first love is the sweetest
But that first cut is the deepest
I tried to keep us together you were busy keeping secrets
Secrets you were telling everybody but me
Don't be fooled by the money I'm still young and just unlucky
I'm surprised you couldn't tell

I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And you're looking for a purpose

I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And you're looking for a purpose"
238,Drake,Hip Hop/Rap,18,Over,"I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year
Who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember at all

What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh yeah that's right
I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm livin' life right now, man
And this is what imma do until it's over
Till it's over, but it's far from over

All right bottles on me, long as imma drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinkin'?
Makin' sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin'
'Bout to set it off in this bitch Jada Pinkett

I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm gettin' home
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone
I can teach you how to speak my language... Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known

'Bout to go Thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need is a fuckin' red jacket with some zippers
Super good Smir-do', a package of the Swishers
I did overnight, it couldn't have happened any quicker

Y'all know them? Well fuck it me either
Point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it
Throwin' hundreds when I should be throwin' ones
Bitch I run it

I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year
Who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember at all

What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh yeah that's right
I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm livin' life right now. man
And this is what imma do until it's over
Till it's over, but it's far from over

One thing about music when it hit you feel no pain
I swear I got that shit that make theses bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me I know better than that
It's just game
It's just what comes with the fame

And I'm ready for that I'm just sayin'
But I really can't complain
Everything is Kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end gettin' any closer

But I probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm ridin' through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your widescreen on
And if you thinkin' imma quit before I die, dream on

They treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feelin' this old
It's about time you admit it who you kiddin'?
Nobody's ever done it like I did it

I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year
Who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember at all

What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh yeah that's right
I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm livin' life right now, man
And this is what imma do until it's over
Till it's over, but it's far from over"
239,Drake,Hip Hop/Rap,18,Tuscan Leather,"Comin' off the last record, I'm gettin' 20 million off the record
Just to off these records, nigga that's a record
I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure
Past the present when you have to mention
This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though
'Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus
We keep it thorough, nigga, rap like this for all of my borough niggas
I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga
Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga
I could go a hour on this beat, nigga
I'm just as famous as my mentor
But that's still the boss, don't get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for
Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more
Hot temper, scary outcome
Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one
That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it
Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it
Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smelling like a brick
Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit
Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich
Self explanatory, you just here to spread the story, wassup

Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV
Young rebel, Young Money nothin' you could tell me
Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me
I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family
Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'
I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it
I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it
Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'
On a mission tryna shift the culture
Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit
Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
Like aye, B I got your CD, you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
I don't change like credentials, you know you see the necklace
My life's a completed checklist
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now
Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now
That's real

How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote we went from Bundy to Winslow
This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna
The Fresh Prince just had dinner with Tatiana, no lie
All these 90's fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if you're fine
That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO
Wanted to tell you, ""Accept yourself""
You don't have to prove shit to know and except yourself
And if you end up needing some extra help, then I can help
You know, back on your feet and shit
Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorcese
And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me, now real nigga wassup"
240,Drake,Hip Hop/Rap,18,Charged Up,"I'm so sorry
Did you hope I was crying?
It was rough without you
It was rough without you

I did some charity today for the kids
But I'm used to it cause all y'all charity cases
All y'all stare in my face in hopes you could be the replacement
Niggas snitching on us without no interrogation
I stay silent 'cause we at war and I'm very patient
Six God is watching, I just hope you're prepared to face him
I'm charged up, I'm charged up

Wow, I'm honored that you think this is staged
I'm flattered man, in fact, I'm amazed
The perfect start to the summer, man this shit is a doozy
This shit the twist in the movie but don't jump to conclusions
You boys are getting into your feelings on me
You should embrace it, this could be one of our realest moments
Okay the flow start to feel familiar, don't it?
Must I remind you that Jimmy got 20 million on it
Need DJ Clue to drop a bomb on it
None of them want this shit more than I want it
I seen it all coming, knew they were pushing buttons
Easter egg hunting, they gotta look for something
Done doing favors for people
Cause it ain't like I need the money I make off a feature
I see you niggas having trouble going gold
Turning into some so and so's that no one knows
But so it go
Come and live all your dreams out at OVO
We gonna make sure you get your bread and you know the ropes
I get a ring and I bring it home like I'm Corey Joe
No woman ever had me star struck
Or was able to tell me to get my bars up
I'm charged up
Oh no we eating, niggas ain't about to starve us
Nah, niggas ain't about to starve us
I'm charged up

I bought my niggas rollies off of Thank Me Later
While these boys was stanky legging
Trust me this information is vital
I'm trying to take the high road
I still got love for my idols
I got me a deal with Apple and I still feel entitled
Rumor has it, there's something that only I know
Rumor has it, I steer this shit with my eyes closed
Rumor has it, I either fucked her or I never could
But rumor has it, hasn't done you niggas any good
It's sound, sound, sound till the day I die
We going live to keep this shit alive
Cops are killing people with their arms up
And your main focus is tryna harm us?
And you think you 'bout to starve us?
Niggas ain't about to starve us
Nah, I'm charged up

Have you seen me?
I'm doing so good
Everytime I leave
Oh, I'm so sorry"
241,Drake,Hip Hop/Rap,18,Thank Me Now,"You could thank me now, uh, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's uh, ok, you could thank me now

Uh, yeah, well all right, here I go

Uh, mahalo from the heart, this act to follow
Lately I been drinkin' like there's a message in a bottle
Aloha's to women with no ties
To men that I know well
That way there are no lies
You could thank me now for all the info
I give to you niggas
I'm on the brink of influential
I'm here for you niggas
I guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggas
I musta been hard to watch
What a year for you niggas
It's December 31st and we in Miami just meditatin'
You got your resolutions, we just got reservations
Livin' out a dream, it feels like I stayed up
And we just wanna party, Pat-ron (?) straight up
Fuck that old shit, I'm on new things
O-V-O Clique, Redwing boo gang
Yeah, we want it all"

You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?
Changing your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you don't have the time to wait on me

I try with you
There's more to life than sleeping in
And getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it

World's, world's, world's famous

Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
Cause you don't mean it anyway, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Maybe we just should have did things my way
Instead of the other way

I tried with you

And getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do

244,Drake,Hip Hop/Rap,18,The Calm,"Uh, I'm just so far gone, October's own, Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne screamin' in the phone
See my house is not a home, fuck is goin' on
Where did we go wrong, where do we belong
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meaning if it rains I'm the one it's raining on
When my diamond chain is on still nothing set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city then these rappers that have blown
It's only been 3 Years look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone, I call this shit the calm
Yeah, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom, and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be ok and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne
I know you like to worry it'll be better if you don't cause...

Talking:
You know, everything gone be all right, I promise. A
Pologize to you know, to put y'all in this position and vent to y'all but...
40 mom always say, ""Don't ask permisson, just ask forgiveness""
You know, so... forgive me.

Uh, And life is so insane, look what I've became, tryna make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention and fore women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that your the one to blame
Tryna enjoy myself with Taz in miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like dwayne
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spottin' me is playin'
So I'm liftin' all alone try not to get a sprain
Hopin' western union doing currency exchange
Cause my dad called and got me feelin' guilty and ashamed
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he payin' for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I could only feel his pain
Cause in memphis tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm fillin' out the form at the counter once a-gain
He say he love me I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why ya girl heart is in a slang
Call me heartbreak Drake I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man I'm just honest as a artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sittin' on my brain
Yeah, And see this is the thang
What they viewing as braggin' is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single handed reason I Remain...

Talking:
Me, Yeah... Uh, I said I call this shit the calm.
But I'm the furthest thing from calm.
I swear I'm puttin' on but they always wanna ask what type of act you puttin' on like... Man."

You were the one
You've been the one
From the moment I seen you
Sometimes I questioned
If this is all real then I grab
On that ass and I firmly believe it

And you
Look like you drawn by an artist
No you
You look like Bernice & Yaris
But both put together
Those are some girls
That I know from back home
If you see 'em you'll get it

Look don't worry about it
Keep speaking Spanish
I'll get it translated
You know you my baby

Anything for you
Anything baby
I do not wanna be enemies baby
I would just much rather give you a baby
And buy you a house
So I live with you baby
Don't stay with this new guy
I really go crazy
I really go crazy

More
Yeah

More time with family and friends, more life
More time to get it right
It's only me, but I'm seeing four shadows in the light
My demons visit me every night
To the most high, I'm forever indebted
I know I gotta pay somethin', I know that day's comin'
I put it all in the music
Because if I don't say it here, then I won't say nothin'
Could feel my hand getting tired from holding the grudges
Two birds, one stone, my aim is amazin'
I need to start losing my shit on you niggas that's hatin'
Too reserved, like I called ahead for me and my lady
Free C5, how the fuck we got the boss waiting?
Ever since the blue basement, I found God and I lost patience
Between rocks and hard places of all places
Spotted everywhere, like Dalmation
Cops snoop around now, 'cause all of my dogs famous
Please welcome the October fall baby
Vaughan Road Academy, star player - my mind's not all there
Used to carry a lot of dead weight like a pallbearer
People too scared to tell the truth, so it's all dares
Count it, it's all there, and we all square
Quick money, I'm in and out
My dad used to use a soap bar 'til it's thinnin' out
But, shit, look at Dennis now
All Stacy Adams and linnen'd out
More blessings for Sandy and him, more life
My parents never got it right
But God bless 'em both, I think we all alike
We all wide awake late at night, thinking on what to change
If we do get to do it twice in another life
Scared to go to sleep now
'Cause being awake is what all my dreams were like
Back when the bar that I had set for myself was out of sight
Tell me how I went and did chin-ups
On this shit when I can't see it
Pin-ups of Meagan Good and Pam Grier
Soul sisters inspired my old scriptures
Now that feeling's gone like them old pictures
Mixin' liquor got us both twisted, words get so vicious
You just stare at me while you roll Swishers
Girl, I love you, but I don't miss ya
And no matter what year it is, I'm a 06er
Go figure, cold nigga, stay in school, man
Fuck the rap game, it's all lies and it's all filthy
Two percent of us rich and the rest of these niggas all milk it
Got two of my niggas off with a ""not guilty""
Gave back to the city and never said it if I didn't live it
But still they try and tell you I'm not the realest
Like I'm some privileged kid
That never sat through a prison visit
Or like it was just handed to me tied with a ribbon
I never worked to get it
But really it's you with all the drug dealer stories
That's gotta stop, though
You made a couple chops and now you think you Chapo
If you ask me though, you ain't lining the trunk with kilos
You bagging weed watching Pacino with all your niggas
Like, ""This what we need to be on,"" but you never went live
You middle-man in this shit, boy, you was never them guys
I can tell, 'cause I look most of you dead in your eyes
And you'll be tryna sell that story for the rest of your lives
Can't show us where the cash is
Me, I don't judge, I'm just going off what the math is
Numbers inflated
They all look at me like, ""What have you done for me lately?""
""I like your older shit but wasn't in love with the latest""
Aw, baby, stop debatin', I'm just a creative
My numbers out of this world
No wonder they got me feeling so alienated
You were the man on the moon
Now you just go through your phases
Life of the angry and famous
Rap like I know I'm the greatest
Then give you tropical flavours
Still never been on hiatus
You stay xann'd and perk'd up
So when reality set in, you don't gotta face it
I'm down 200 in Vegas but winning life on a daily basis
It seems like nobody wants to stay in my good graces
I'm like a real estate agent, putting you all in your places
Look what happens soon as you talk to me crazy
Is you crazy?"
247,Drake,Hip Hop/Rap,18,Nothings Into Somethings,"You ever hear some slow tracks, you know what I'm sayin'?
With, like, some pimpin' to it, or somethin'
That you can relax, pop a top to, or somethin'?

Big cup of Ac', I'm drowsy
I'm still posted up where you first found me
Did I just read that you just got engaged on me?
I heard from your friend, you couldn't even tell me
Or better yet wait on me

Nah, sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Can't just leave it off that way
Sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Sha-nah-nah-nah
Can't just leave it off that way, nah

Least, do I get an invitation or something?
A statement or something?
Ask about that, you would say it was nothing
But here's another nothing that you made into something
Can't just leave it off that way"
248,Drake,Hip Hop/Rap,18,The Language,"I don't know why they been lying but yo shit is not that inspiring
Bank account statements just look like I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talkin' that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum, I looked at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one that you should worry about
I don't know who you're referring to, who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplaying the money but that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time putting money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour and you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the making, it's all for the city
You know I come right every summer, Cash Money Records forever
I'm always big timing, bitch, I came up right under Stunna
You know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said ""Girl, that's all that we do""
Okay, now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said ""Girl, that's all that we do""

I'm about to roll one and light it and fuck it man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit that's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you whylin', I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands and eat with Italians, I do
People are funny; you don't even know about the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed, it could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me, just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days and she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
Been workin' so hard on the album I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna
You know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said ""Girl, that's all that we do""
Okay, now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language

Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you

You understand me?

Big time, sunshine, tote nines
Bust mines, flatline, hard grind
High life, stay fly as jet time

Every time you see a nigga

Every time you see a nigga

Swag on head to feet nigga
Stunt nigga

Drake
It's time to change your mobile Ringtone!
(Drake)
These girls ain't got nothing on you
Uh, say baby I had to mention
That if you were a star you'd be the one I'm searching for
Other girls they got attention
But I just always feel like there in need of something you got
Obvious you're pretty
Heard that you're a student working weekends in the city
Trying to take you out girl, hope your not too busy
And if there's nothing wrong, got this little song
For you to get ready to
Put those f-cking heels on and work it girl
Let that mirror show you what your doing
Put that f-cking dress on and work it kind of vicious
Like somebody's taking pictures

Shut it down down down
You would shut it down down down
You be the baddest girl around round round
And they notice they notice
You would shut it down down down
You be the baddest girl around round round
And they notice they notice
You would shut it, hey oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you nothing on you

What you need
(The Dream)
I can be (I can be)
Your everything

(Who knew)
Them other n-ggas
Just wanna hit it but if they had it
Wouldn't know what to do with it
(And together)


(Drake and The Dream)
We shut it down down down
They know we shut it down down down
Your the baddest girl around...

You shut that muthf-cker down down
Ice cream conversations they all want the scoop
You shut that muthaf-cker down down down
Oh yeah,
Yes indeed, you shut it down down

You shut that sh-t down
(Down down down)
You shut it down
You shut it down

You shut it down
You shut it, oh

You looking good girl
Go go go get 'em girl,
Go go go go hit 'em girl
Go go go go go go
You shut it down"
250,Drake,Hip Hop/Rap,18,Hate Sleeping Alone (Bonus Track),"She says ""kiss me like you miss me, fuck me like you hate me
And when you're fucking someone else just fuck her like she ain't me""
Damn, those words are scary, those words are scary virgin Mary
I just tell her to spare me
I was in love 2 years ago and gave the baggage to my ex
It's all for her to carry, bags she deserve to carry
I hate that ho, I make it so hard just to talk, don't I?
I get off topic don't I? I get it poppin' don't I?
I'll end up stopping won't I? And by the time I end up stopping
You'll be rocking one of the rings that you pointed out while shopping with a nigga don't lie
She's losing it right now, 'cause if I wasn't who I am, she would've been moving in by now
But instead we're moving slow -- I guess she's used to it by now
And she gives me all her trust and I'm abusing it right now
But this money coming in is just confusing shit right now
You just told me I ain't shit and I guess I'm proving it right now

I say I'd rather be with you but you are not around
So I'mma call somebody up and see if they be down
'Cause I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
So she's here and we're both so gone

Hotel to hotel, girl -- I could use your company
Full name and birthday, I book a flight, you come to me
But she don't want a weekend -- she wants all of me or none of me
If she can't work with all of me then she say she done with me
You say that you over me you always end up under me
You know how it goes -- don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me
Don't start with yo shit -- I put you back in yo place
She tells me ""I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face""
And hangs up yeah, how dare you tell me it's tougher for you
Like I don't hear about the niggas you fucking with, too
And whoever I be with, they got nothing on you
That's just something to do when there's nothing to do
Yeah, but she's losing it right now
She has choices she should make I think she's choosing it right now
One more chance to make it right, I think I'm using it right now
You just said I never learn I guess I'm proving it right now

I say I'd rather be with you but you are not around
So I'mma call somebody up and see if they be down
'Cause I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
So she's here and we're both so gone"
251,Drake,Hip Hop/Rap,18,Doing It Wrong,"When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too

But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)

We live in a generation of not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else

(Outro - Stevie Wonder Harmonica)"
252,Drake,Hip Hop/Rap,18,Furthest Thing,"Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl I always stay down
Get down, have her lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now
So much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show their face now
What they got to say now?
Nothing they can say now
Nothing really changed but still they look at me away now
What more can I say now?
What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothing was the same

I still been drinking on the low
Mobbin on the low
Fuckin' on the low
Smokin' on the low

Just too busy running shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it
I can't help it
I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me
Stop pretending, stop that fronting
I can't take it
Girl don't treat me like a stranger
Girl you know I seen ya naked
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Getting high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscing
And makeup sex is tradition
But you've been missing girl
And you might feel like nothing was the same

This the life for me
My mama told me this was right for me
I got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have spoons, serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rapping different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin
Naked women swimming that's just how I'm living
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feeling
A nigga filling up arenas, who the fuck can see us
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly the boy
I just build and build more
Y'all niggas build and destroy
You niggas party too much, man I just chill and record
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't fill it before

Better than 'em telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny 'cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace, but I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now
I made a decision last night that I would die for it

(Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six)
(Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six)

All these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand
I'mma start telling niggas ""Get it how you can""
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend
If I ever lose a bet, we never speak again
I made a decision last night that I'd die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5 for it
Keychain go jangalang, I wanna do major things
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away
Six upside down, it's a nine now
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now

Swear to God, shout to Buffalo, never duckin' low
I don't stop, man, I'm stuck on go, always hug the road
Fuck a opp, make his body roll, yeah, a lot of those
Started out doin' college shows, Calipari flow

All that Drake hysteria
Six side, east side, all that for my area

You know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainly stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I'm confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days. When others go low, we go high."

More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing you'll never lose me
LOLOL I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she's always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'

That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?

Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow, Oh, oh

Treating diamonds of Atlanta like it's king of diamonds
Take a flick I look like Meechy look like Bleu DaVinci
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City
Man I told my city I'd be gone till November, then November came
Then I came, right back on my worst behav'

I forgot about you last night
For the first time in a long time I did
I was caught up in these drinks they keep on making
An amazin conversation with this girl named Lorraine
Who says she's from L.A.
Who keeps makin' me laugh and even asks if she can pay
Ooh
She could be good for me (yeah)
This what you text me
Tell me that you miss me
I forget about Lorraine
And in fact she's right here with me
And she's starin' at my face
Something had to change
Thought that all these feelings went away (yeah)

I hate gettin' messages from you (from you)
It's like you know the perfect shit to say

F-cks up my whole day
Thought that all these feelings went away

I hate gettin' messages from you (from you)
Especially when you say you should've stayed
F-cks up my whole day
I thought that all these feelings went away

I hate the shit you do
I hate the shit you do

Yeah
She said she workin' for Walgreens but not in the store, at the head office
The head was so good it make sense why you work at the head office
In 2007 I sat in a lobby in Motown and waited
Now I walk into the buildin' and go off like ""Nigga we made it!""
When I walk through these halls, man this beat should be playin'
I just came to make sure you not missin' no payments
Now turn this shit down while I issue my statement
It needed a moment of silence, nigga we made it!
You fly out your lady, I fly out my ladies
Bitches can't front on the kid anymore, man they know what my name is
And if by chance she don't know who I am, she just know that I'm famous
Imma just hand her a business card and say ""Nigga we made it!""
And she gotta come to the hotel and pop it off for me
Then she gon' text her best friend like ""Girl he got some good dick and money""
Her friend hit her back like ""I know that already, that nigga's amazin'""
Then I send a message to both of they asses like ""Nigga we made it!""

Kinda makes me wonder
Why the hell so many people are tryna tell me to slow down.
Seems like motherfuckers should be shuttin' the hell up and enjoyin' the show

Aye

Damn we made it
Nigga we made it, aye

If they with me, just know that they wit' it and 'bout it
If I said it, I meant it, it's no way around it
OVO, Reps Up, and P. Reign is next up, watch Gway go crazy
When Baka came home for the holidays, I was like ""Nigga we made it!""
And all of those lawyer fees, nigga I paid it
My family get all of my loyalty, all of my patience
My life for your life, man I wouldn't trade it
I would just look at you dead in the face and say ""Nigga we made it!""
I swear that we made it, sell out that thing, I'm the king in Jamaica
But I've been on that wave, that's why this year I tell yah, I don't need no favors
(Damn, Soulja Boy stunt on them haters)
And my resolution for New Years is nigga we made it!
You don't know how long I waited
I coulda been waitin' on tables, my karma's amazin'
I'm out in the Caymans
Rented a 12-bedroom house just to sleep all the women we came with
That's ignorant, ain't it?
Sometimes I question myself when I think 'bout the pictures I painted
Then I pick up my brush and I sign at the bottom
Like ""Nigga we made it!""

Aye
We made it
Nigga we made it, aye
Damn we made it

How long spent in the hood
Tellin' my partner
And my momma, everything gonna be all good
Nigga we made it!
Damn
I'm up in Las Vegas
Damn, I never was supposed to have shit
Now my life is lavish
Every night, fuckin' a bad bitch,
Nigga we made it!
Coppin' a Lambo, cash,
The Bentley, 2 times I crashed
Nigga we made it!
Look at them niggas' faces, them niggas, they hate it
I look a nigga in his face and say ""Nigga we made it!""
Soulja Boy stunt on them haters
And these days I don't need no favors
Nigga we made it!

You would love it if I went away or didn't say nothing else
How am I keeping it real by keeping this shit to myself?
You was never gang, gang, gang, gang, you was never one of us
Had us fooled for a minute there, now we done all grown up
But I'm better off anyway, y'all never gon' finish Drake

265,Drake,Hip Hop/Rap,18,Buried Alive Interlude,"If you was in a pine box
I would surely break the lock
I'd jump right in and fall asleep
Cause you are the death of me

(Kendrick Lamar)
Looking in the mirror I'm embarrassed
I'm feeling like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I'm in the matter of man arm wrestling
Hands I was dealt when I said the music business was all I needed
When I got it I was greeted by an alien
That said last year that she slept with a Canadian
That gave him an addiction that would keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend
My vice is similar women love when you're my type
And you're winning from everything that your palm write
Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city
Devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel
Live the ambiance all cause the audience
One day said I would do it
So instead of a verse being read
I'mma go and get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch your ass too fat
Capitalize That, and your weave look good with the Indian tracks
Tracking device on your used 5 series
I don't call back just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say were in the area cruisin' in Toronto
Hit me on the cellular, thought he was gonna sell me a false word
Like the rappers I know
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can't see us
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black Maybach, 40 pulled up Jeep
No doors all that nigga was missing was Aaliyah
Felt like the initiation
A reality living in the matrix
We talk casually about the industry
And how the women be the taste makers for the shit we making
Then he said that he was the same age as myself
And it didn't help cause it made me even more rude an impatient
So blame it on Mr. OVOXO, the reason why I'm breathing all the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason why, the highlight was when he said:
You belong to the people when you outside
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy, full of fame
And bury yourself alive, then I died"
266,Drake,Hip Hop/Rap,18,Under Ground Kings,"Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn't be driving, it just got so much harder
Can't even see straight, I can't even see straight
Oh, fuck with me, I buy the shots
Live a little, cause niggas die a lot, and lie a lot
But I'm the truth -- that's right, I fucking said it
The living proof that you don't gotta die to get to heaven
You girl, you right there, you look like you like this hit
How'd I know, how'd I know? That's me on some psychic shit
I can tell a lie if you ask me my where-abouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rap and bitches, rap and bitches bitches
And rappin', rappin' and bitches until all of it switches
I swear, it's been two years since somebody asked me who I was
I'm the greatest man, I said that before I knew I was
That's what's important and what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing ""walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, ah""
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways

People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas)

Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper that's gon' tell me that she don't dance
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all the good things, that's all I'm really good for
Memphis Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back
And Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth
And they rockin' furs like it's snowing in the south
And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like
So why am I in class if this is who I'm trying to be like
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
As soon I realize that turning papers in won't get me paid
If I don't nothing I'mma ball
I'm counting all day like a clock on the wall
Yeah, I need that, making major changes to the life I'm living
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decisions
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways"
267,Drake,Hip Hop/Rap,18,Keep the Family Close,"It's a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond me

All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
'Cause I can't depend on you anymore

Always saw you for what you could've been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car that looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you could've been
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet and now we're meeting our end

And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

You're so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in L.A. I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's going on

And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing 'cause I'm living right
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving them all like I'm working for minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling the way
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day

All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need your family for
'Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Much closer

Anytime people want to start problems
It's like ""for real, are you dumb?""
You know who man's are
I'm not afraid no gyal heart man
And I'm not afraid of no cyattie
And I'm not afraid of no waste yute neither
So anybody who want it can get it

Bar mitzvah money like my name Mordehigh
Fuck you bitch, I'm on that high

This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. going shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stunting, I'll forever be immortalized

I keep thinking how young you can die from old age
They always tell me nobody's working as hard as you
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true
'Cause while all of my closest friends out partying
I'm just here making all the music that they party to
But party on, party on, all night nigga
I got these new rappers nervous prom night nigga
I've grown tired of these fucking grown man liars
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire
Uh, but I just wanna tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
This shit feel like when Fredro Starr was at Sunset Park
Stuntin' hard in his yellow Goose
Yeah, but I'm a ma'fuckin' missed target
But a target nonetheless and I just started
Was that directed at moi? It can't be
They must be talking to themselves, hoes hands free
Yeah, and I'm just filling up this daily planner
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star, no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends, Kelsey Grammar
Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doing you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you,
And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwin' you
Just know that she gon' tell another nigga when she through wit you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all even when it tastes too strong
Yeah, I gotta feel alive, even if it kills me
I promise to always give you me, the real me

(Chorus: Drake)
Who would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
(Hey, Guru, tell hom' to go to open that Ace right there),
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down
I'm gon' make this go

(Verse 2: Jay-Z)
Owww, hoes turn they heads like, owls
I'm the man of the hour
Triple entendre, don't even ask me how
Con Edison flow, I'm connected to a higher power
Bright life'd make your whole city light up
A trillion-watt light bulb, when I'm in the nightclub
I just landed in that G450
Caught the Mayweather fight, 'cause the satellite was crispy
(Uh) Y'all can miss me with that money talk
The smart money's on Hov, fuck what the dummies talk
I don't do too much blogging
I just run the town, I don't do too much jogging
(Unh) I ain't got a scar yet
'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched
Drake, here is how they gon' come at you
Will silly raps for you tryin' to distract you
In disguise, in the form of a favor
The Barzini me, watch for the traitors
(Unh) I done seen it all, done it all
That's why none of these dumb-dumb could dun him off
The summer's ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7
You let 'em tell it, they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was, cool as The Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me
But I would've went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas, bitches too
All I got is this money, this'll do

(Chorus: Drake)
Who would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Wait until the sun goes down
I'm gon' make this go"

I live for the nights that I can't remember,
With the people that I won't forget
Spending all the money I just work my ass off
For the things that I won't regret

I've been waiting way too long long long long
Tellin' everybody that I know we about to be on on on on
I ain't tryin' look like I lie to these niggas that I came up with
That's my team, never would I let a woman come between
What we doing right now

This our dream, Wu Tang Clan niggas want that cream
I'm the Osirus of the shit right now
Go to guy for the hits right now
Whatever you wanna drink girl pick right now
If you can't hold your liquor you better quit right now

How 'bout you and all your morals in that outfit that you borrowed
Make the most out of tonight and worry 'bout it all tomorrow
Understand girl, we fam girl
Can't get me right and I do Wayne
Cash money, Young Money, pop champagne

Presidential suite girl Barrack Hussain
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg
People really hate when a backpack rapper get rich
And start livin' that life dawg

Feels like when you gettin' to that paper hip hop hates ya
They would do it just like I do if they could
It's in our nature
Ah, young and rich and out of control

Out in L.A. blowing clouds of that killer
I came up in the underground though
So imma spend another ten thousand for Dilla
Call me overrated or creative or too jaded
Because any way you put it bitch I made it, yup"
277,Drake,Hip Hop/Rap,18,The Motion,"It's not me and you
It's not me. It's you

I guess that's just the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (ooh)

I don't have a fuck to give
I been moving state to state
In my leather and my Tims
Like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chubb
That's my nigga from the way
On the East side of the city
That's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling
'Cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it
I can never do no wrong
When they need a favor from ya man they don't leave you alone

But, I guess that's just the motion
And their phone doesn't ring when they got everything
That's the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (ooh)

Yeah,
Looking back on it at least my pride is in tact
'Cause we said no strings attached
And I still got tied up in that
Every thing that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her
And she know it
The girl that I want to save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that want to be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help

But, I guess that's just the motion
Yeah, she'll probably come around soon as I settle down
That's the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (ooh)

Nothing less and nothing more
I hear your heart hit the floor
(I guess that's just the motion)
Talking to you's not enough (no oh)

I guess that's just the motion (oh)
I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion"

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you

(Verse 1: Drake)
Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out mo'
I've been stackin' up like I'm fund-raisin'
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls, and then end up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it; I just ride with it
Moment I stop havin' fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's puttin' shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summer time, I keep it 100
Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like ""Is Bun comin'?
Fuck that, is anyone comin' before I show up there and there's no one there?""
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, ""Take a deep breath, you're too worried about bein' the best out""

(Hook: Sampha)

Uh -
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family goin' backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like ""Oh well, this is life, I guess."" Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
I hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, tellin' herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round
Started treatin' me like I'm ""him"" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feelin' pinned down, pick the pen up and put the pen down
I'm writin' to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much

You woulda liked it
Uh uh nah, I know you all too well
I said that we can kiss the past goodbye, but you weren't excited
There's no way to fight it, you can stay but shawty here I go

(Drake - Verse 1)
Should I spend the weekend in Vegas
I'm living inside the moment
Not taking pictures to save it
I mean how could I forget
My memories never faded

I can't relate to these haters
My enemies never made it
I am... still here with who I started with
The game needed life, I put my heart in it
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit
Carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship

Uh, I'm 23 with a money tree
Growing more too, I just planted 100 seeds
It's ironic 'cause my mother was a florist and that's how she met my pops and now my garden is enormous

It's happening Penny Lane, just like you said
I avoided the Coke game and went with Sprite instead, uh ah
That's word to the millions that they putting up
I'm trying to do better than good enough!

What am I afraid of
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
The people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
(They say)
You promised me you would never change oh, huh huh oh, huh huh, oh
You promised me you would never change oh, huh huh oh, huh huh, oh

(Drake - Verse 2)
Am I wrong for making light of my situation
Clap on, when 40 got some shit for me to snap on
Now that I'm on I don't want to really worry about getting back on
I'm just trying to stay on
Get my fucking buffet on

I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home
And I'll be acting like I don't know how to work a phone
But hit redial you'll see that I just called some chick I met at the mall
That I barely know at all and ...

Plus this women that I mess with unprotected
Text us saying she wish she woulda kept it
The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it
Man I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is

I'm holding on by a thread it's like I'm high right now
The guy right now, and you can tell by looking in my eyes right now
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now
'Cause we just having the time of our lives right now

What am I afraid of
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
The people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
(They say)
You promised me you would never change oh, huh huh oh, huh huh, oh
You promised me you would never change oh, huh huh oh, huh huh, oh

(Drake - Verse 3)
I live by some advice this girl Lissa told me
The other day Lissa told me that she missed the old me
Which made me question when I went missing
And when I start treating my friends different

Maybe it was the fast pace switch up or the two guns in my face during the stick up
Maybe 'cause a girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up
But a fact I haven't seen 'em since they locked big Rich up
I know, the same time I'm quick to forget

About to roll me a blunt with my list of regrets
Burn it all burn it all, I'm starting it fresh
'Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed

Did I just trade free time for camera time
Will I blow all of this money baby, Hammer time
Yeah, I just need some closure, ain't no turning back for me
I'm in it till it's over"

They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just done in the hype

Bustin' 1's out the plastic
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta go, they gotta go
They gonna die out eventually
I cannot give 'em no empathy
I'ma have B's when I'm 70
They cannot fuck with the legacy

And you don't do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself you're the fucking coldest

Intelligent too, ooh you're my sweetheart
I've always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days

You're all my nights I don't know what to do

Stop making a big deal out of the little things
'Cause I got big deals and I got little things
I got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things, let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

Don't sleep when you know you got it good girl

Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl

And that's everything about you that's just how I feel about you
Been about you and I'm still about you but
We ain't finished talking
I told you you don't need to worry about them bitches
All them fives need to listen when the ten is talking
'Cause they don't wanna see you happier than them and girl you swear
They are your friends and there's been a problem
You the one they hate, just come with that
I know you think its funny that your ex is not a running back
But that nigga came running back
And you tell me that you're done with that
And I believe its true, long as you know who you belong to

All I'm really asking for is you"

288,Drake,Hip Hop/Rap,18,Connect,"Isn't it amazing how you talk all this shit and we still lack communication
How beautiful our kids will be, girl, I don't need convincing
How every conversation starts with this time will be different
Oh the ideas funny, oh the ideas funny
Oh the idea is so fun every time
At least we try for homerun every time

Swanging, eyes closed just swanging
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume 'cause I don't expect assumptions babe
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' babe
Swangin'

She just wanna run around the city and make memories
That she can barely remember
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
She just wanna run over my feelin's
Like she drinkin' and drivin' in an 18 wheeler
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
She used to say ""You can be whoever you want, even yourself""
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was and never leave as myself
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground
Cause you would learn to love people and use things
And not the other way around

Swanging, eyes closed just swanging
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume 'cause I don't expect assumptions babe
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' babe
Swangin'

I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is
She call and tell me be here before the sun up
I be dressed before we hung up
I take Eglinton to 401 east
And exit at Markham road and the East end
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping
My license been expired I renew it after the weekend
Fuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends
Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness
I hate stoppin' for gas this late
Cause this nigga's creepin' and I like how we're creepin'
Summer is comin' know you could feel it
20 on pump whatever I ain't got enough to fill it
Won't knock on your door
My uncle say, ""You drive my whip like it's yours""
I got the pedal to the floor
I'm on my motherfuckin' way swangin'

Don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'll be there just swangin'
I'll be there just swangin'
I treat you good girl like you're famous
I know I'm late it's always the same shit

I'm on the road right now swangin, girl"
289,Drake,Hip Hop/Rap,18,Views,"Question is will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no, no, no, no
Question is will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no, no, no, no

Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression coming out of my section
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playing dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They been saying it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesay's, I was buying fitteds everyday
Kiddie's Caribana trying not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day
""It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait""
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
I'm getting straight to the point with it
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas
Fuck being all buddy buddy with the opposition
It's like a front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute

Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards them goals
My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
Who you think running this show?
You saw it in me at 20 years old
The lingo start to sound like we talking in code
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
You don't worry 'bout fitting in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doing shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers going unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feeling like I'm Christian Bale
And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales
Tipping scales, bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
Running through the 6, thumbing through the contracts
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got something left to prove since you left me room
Paint a plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's going in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karma's such a thing of beauty
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
It's far fetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it 100 like I'm running a fever
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you
If I was you, I wouldn't like me either"

A bunch of handshakes from the fakes
But nigga I do not want to be friends though
I told y'all mothafuckas, man, this shit is not a love song
This a fuck a stripper on a mink rug song
This a fuck them boys forever, hold a grudge song
Pop some fucking champagne in the tub song, nigga, ""just because"" song

What's the move? Can I tell the truth?
If I was doing this for you then I'd have nothing left to prove
Nah, this for me, though
I'm just trynna stay alive and take care of my people

I got my whole country on a new wave
She like, ""I heard all your niggas stay where you stay""

I saw my parents split up right after the wedding
That taught my ass to stay committed, fuck the credit

Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got Google alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry 'bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said ""I heard you back with you know who
I told her ""Girl I'm always back with you know who""
And she like ""Who are we kidding
You're only 27 you just being you
You're your fathers child man thank god you got some me in you""
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher but your words still got me evolving
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solving
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that there's always someone better
Like that girl from that gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free Thursday
And I'm sure that she's a angel but she don't want this life
The timing ain't right
Maybe one day but even one day with us is a time of a life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart but I'm not here to give out compliments, or boost nobody confidence momma
I got no friends in this momma
I don't pretend with this momma
I'on joke with this momma
I pull the knife out my back and cut they throat with it momma
I'm ""Game of Thrones"" with it momma
I'm "" Home Alone"" with it momma

I really hate getting aggressive on this phone with you momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two momma
It's just they cloning me momma

It's like - I'm the one they wanna be momma
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable momma
I mean I kill 'em every time they do a song with me momma
I sing a hook they sing along with me momma
What more they want from me momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
""Don't ever take advice,"" that was great advice
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life

Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real, girl he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
But he just want our forgiveness, and fuck it look how we living
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like
I used to rap on the phone, one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny shit could've gone south for me he looked out for me ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black, and now I'm here and I'm not black enough
'Cause I'm not acting tough or making stories up bout where I'm actually from
But I just roll with it momma, rolling stone with it momma
Gotta be careful around rolling stones or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me momma
I'm not condoning it momma
They will not tear nothing down I built this home for you momma

And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club

They got me on these white women like Seal nigga
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field nigga, yeah
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin' off of what ain't mine
And I be hearing shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
It's been that way from the beginning
I just been playing, I ain't even know that I was winning

But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back paving the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together -- I hope she frames it!
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with
Feel like I've been here before huh?

I'm in control but with you bein a man you don't seem to understand that,
I-I-I'm ready for ya
I-ohoh, I-I-I'm ready for ya
I-ohoh, I-I-I'm ready for ya
I-ohoh, so keep thinkin' your the man cause that's all part of my plan,
I-I-I'm ready for ya

Nothin' on, I strut around, I do it big, I shut it down
I wonder if you'll be able to handle me
Mental pictures, no cameras please

Red lipstick on the wine glass, cameras in my mind flash
Black loungeray, white diamonds what a contrast

I know you get impatient as the time pass, you say you want it fast, define fast
'Cause I could speed it up and make it last
And I could audition for this and I could be part of the cast
And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past
And make damn sure that you never forget it,
Admitt it
I'm ready
I'm wit it
Still here like a statue pink champaigne
Green ink in your tattoos
You say you got baggage well I'm packed too
Plus I got a sex pistol pointed right at you
BANG
The baddest woman ever and the hardest ?????
Proven over and over again that's why I'm hard to doubt
Plus I'm young money till death
I took the carter out
I'm more then ready too, hope it's somethin' you thought about

I-I-I'm ready for ya

R.I.P to the girl you used to see
Her days are over
Baby she's over

I-I-I'm ready for ya
I-ohoh, I-I-I'm ready for ya
I-ohoh, I-I-I'm ready for ya
I-ohoh, so keep thinkin' your the man cause that's all part of my plan,
I-I-I'm ready for ya."
302,Drake,Hip Hop/Rap,18,Trust Issues,"All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya

I'm on one
Yeah, fuck it, I'm on one
Yeah, I said I'm on one
Fuck it, I'm on one
A strong one

Two white cups and I got that drink
It could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money that we got, never get that shit

'Cause I'm on one
Fuck it I'm on one
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

You know what I'm like, oh yes, oh yeah
Oh yes, Oh yeah
Oh yes, Oh yeah

You know what I'm sippin, I teach you how to mix it
But you're the only one, 'cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches
They might catch me slippin'
So you're the only one, 'cause I don't trust these bitches
They might, they might catch me slippin' and put in something different
So your the only one

'Cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches
They might catch me slippin'
So you're the only one

Oh Ooh, trust issues
Oh Ooh, trust issues
Oh Ooh, trust issues
Oh Ooh ooh ooh

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Lets call up I'm drinkin', lets all get wasted
I'm drinkin', lets all get faded

Drizzy Drake, check me out
Coming live from the the muthafucking north side
Kick game, run game, run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sittin' courtside
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You actin' like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me how the fuck we supposed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show
I can tell, I can tell, I can tell certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more
Guess they don't really make 'em like me no more
Uh, you can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
'Cause if ya what I created than I hate myself
But still, let them girls in,
And tell 'em all leave their cell phones on the table where we see 'em
I'm all day with it man, AM to the PM
Niggas hatin', I just wish they would say it when I see 'em all

That's that shit that drives me crazy
And it's all that I've been gettin' lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women wanna fuck t like they're me and I'm them
Looking for some things that I think I can find in you, in you

Oh Ooh, trust issues
Oh Ooh, trust issues
Oh Ooh, trust issues
Oh Ooh ooh oh

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Lets call up I'm drinkin', lets all get wasted
I'm drinkin', lets all get faded
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Call up on drinkin', lets call up"
311,Jason Aldean,Country,6,You Make It Easy,"Like a rainy Sunday morning makes me want to stay in bed
Twisted up all day long
You're my inspiration, girl you take me places
Put the words right into these songs

Stealing kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

You make it easy
Lovin' up on you
Make it easy
With every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my saving grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

You took all my rough around the edges
Never let it ruffle up your feathers, angel
Yeah I'm down for life, you got me wrapped around your finger
And I like it just in case you can't tell

You make it easy
Lovin' up on you
Make it easy
With every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my saving grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

Stealing kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

You make it easy
Lovin' up on you
Make it easy
With every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my saving grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy
You make it easy"
312,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Miss That Girl,"I found her silver bracelet in my backseat
The night she left, it seems like yesterday
It's like I found a treasure when I held it
How could I have ever let her get away

I still got a faded picture on my rearview
It's almost like she's lookin' right at me
Somehow just like that, it all comes rushin' back
She's right here the way it used to be
Yeah

I miss that girl
Knowin' they'll never be another one like her, not like her
Kickin' myself for ever lettin' her slip out of my world
I just miss that girl

Way back then it felt like I had things together
Whenever she'd come smilin' through that door
But I've had one or two tonight
And it just makes me realize
That I ain't so together anymore

And why I miss that girl
Knowin' they'll never be another one like her, not like her
Kickin' myself for ever lettin' her slip out of my world
I just miss that girl

Yeah, I miss that girl
Yeah

I miss that girl
Knowin' they'll never be another one like her, not like her
Kickin' myself for ever letting' her slip out of my world
I just miss that girl

I still miss that girl"
313,Jason Aldean,Country,6,In Case You Don't Remember,"In case you don't remember
I left a picture of us on the hood of your truck from that spring break
We were young and a little bit crazy enough to just think
We were gonna be something
Yeah weren't we something
A little bit burned a little bit buzzed didn't feel it
Still got the hat that you wore flip back I wear it
Yeah I swear it

There was magic in the air it was everywhere that we touched down
The carnival ride and the high we were on as it went around
It was us against the world and you swore girl that we'd never surrender
But I still can't forget you girl
In case you don't remember

I still got the key to the room that we never slept in
Yeah the love we made you let it fade away well I kept it
And I don't regret it

There was magic in the air it was everywhere that we touched down
The carnival ride and the high we were on as it went around
It was us against the world and you swore girl that we'd never surrender
But I still can't forget you girl
In case you don't remember

The last time we kissed
The taste of my lips
The way we couldn't say goodbye

There was magic in the air it was everywhere that we touched down
The carnival ride and the high we were on as it went around
There was something in the way that you swore girl
That we'd never surrender but I still can't forget you girl
No I won't ever forget you girl
In case you don't remember

I left a picture of us on the hood of your truck from that spring break"
314,Jason Aldean,Country,6,On My Highway,"On my highway the yellow lines,
Have disappeared from time to time,
And I've wound up on the wrong side of the road,
On my highway I've gone to fast,
Afraid that I might finish last,
I hooked a curve too hard and lost control,
Oh I never know which way it's gonna go,

But what a feeling chasing the sun,
Living my life like it's shot from a gun,
Laughing a little bit more with every mile,
Oh what a freedom racing the wind,
Dying to know what's around the next bend,
And smiling as I watch the years roll by,
I'm learning how to take it day by day on my highway,

On my highway I missed some signs,
And left a damn good love behind,
I see her in my rear view like a ghost,
On my highway I've broken down,
And cried when no one else was around,
And prayed that God would save my soul,
Ya I've paid a lot of heavy tolls,

Yeah Yeah,
What a feeling out on the run,
Drinking up the rain soaking up the sun,
Laughing a little bit more with ever mile,
Oh what a freedom like a sail in the wind,
Not looking back not forgetting where I've been,
Smiling as I watch the years roll by,
I'm moving on from my mistakes,
And I'm learning how to take it day by day,
On my highway,"
315,Jason Aldean,Country,6,This Plane Don't Go There,"There's a moment I can see when I close my eyes from this window seat
It's you and me under a midnight sky
Leaning on your car in the parking lot, wish I could go back to that spot
The second right before we said goodbye

But this plane don't go there
This plane can't take me back in time
I could go anywhere
I can't go back to that night
If I could, I would, I swear
But this plane don't go there

I wish there were runway lights where they could land this thing tonight
You'd be right there waiting at the gate
I would stop you just before you're reaching for that drivers door
If yesterday could be today

But this plane don't go there
This plane can't take me back in time
I could go anywhere
I can't go back to that night
If I could, I would, I swear
But this plane don't go there

She's down there somewhere...
If I could go back there...

But this plane don't go there
This plane can't take me back in time
I could go anywhere
I can't go back to that night
If I could, I would, I swear
But this plane don't go there

No this plane don't go there..."
316,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Wide Open,"The corner cafe,
She scrapes some quarters off the table,
Says thanks yeah now maybe I'll be able,
To get that black Mercedes,
I've been saving for,
The other girls say,
You outta undue a couple buttons,
Start showing off a little something,
She says naw you go ahead,
Think I'd rather stay poor,
See I'm just making rent,
She said this ain't where my road ends

This may not be my town,
It'll do for now,
Till I can figure out,
Who I am,
Where I'm going,
She's slinging eggs and bacon,
With a college education
Just hanging out and waiting,
For a better plan,
She's ok not knowing,
She's young,
And the worlds wide open.

There's a rusty old ford,
Lives out back behind the diner,
Sitting there waiting on her to make her mind up,
It tends to sling a little gravel,
And take her who knows where,
Maybe head out west,
It's in Gods hands I guess.

She throws down that apron,
Takes the money she's been making,
Her life's out there waiting,
Got a better plan,
That's where she's going,
She's young,"
317,Jason Aldean,Country,6,I'm Just a Man,"I'm a blue collar man had a hammer in my hand
For the last few years of my life
Working double overtime
While you sleep alone at night
Baby I know it's been a long hard ride
Sometimes I forget to say I love you
But baby please know that I do, Yeah

I live this life everyday
I make my share of mistakes
And every lesson I've learned
I've learned the hard way
I do the best that I can
And I hope you understand
After all, I'm just a man

I found a postcard that you've saved
That's turned yellow with age
Of a beautiful place in the sun
We've been saying every year that we're gonna go there
And run away just the two of us
Well I put that picture back on your dresser
Grab my keys, I got to get back to work, Yeah

I live this life everyday
I make my share of mistakes
And every lesson I've learned
I've learned the hard way
I do the best that I can
And I hope you understand
After all, I'm just a man

318,Jason Aldean,Country,6,My Kinda Party,"I worked all week
Cleaned up, clean cut, and clean shaved
Got the cover off a '68
I fired it up, and let them horses sing
A little pretty thing

A little tan leg Georgia dream
She's a rockin' them holey jeans
Baby, what you got goin' on Saturday?
You know, words got it, there's gonna be a party,
Out of town about half a mile
Four wheel drives and big mud tires
Muscadine wine

Oh baby, you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sittin' 'round watchin' all these pretty things
I get down in that Georgia clay

And I'll find peace
In the bottom of a real tall cold drink
Chillin' with some Skynyrd and some old Hank
Let's get this thing started
It's my kind of party

Well if you wanna drink
Go on baby, just do your thing
But give up your keys
Hell why drive when you can stay with me?
And then after while we'll sneak away from the bonfire

Walk by the moonlight and down to the riverside
Gotcha sippin' on the moonshine
Baby, if you're in mood and you can settle for a one night rodeo
If you can be my tan-legged Juliet
I'll be your Redneck Romeo

Oh baby, you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sittin' 'round watchin' all these pretty things
I get down in that Georgia clay

And I'll find peace
In the bottom of a real tall cold drink
Chillin' with some Skynyrd and some old Hank
Let's get this thing started
It's my kind of party

Oh baby, you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sittin' 'round watchin' all these pretty things
I get down in that Georgia clay

And I'll find peace
In the bottom of a real tall cold drink
Chillin' with some Skynyrd and some old Hank
Let's get this thing started
It's my kind of party

Haha, y'all ready for this?
Y'all go head and turn it on up"
319,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Staring at the Sun,"She's like starin' at the sun
She could easily blind someone
Other women, I see none
She's like starin' at the sun

She gets on you
Under your skin like a tattoo
She'll always be there
She holds on, stuck in your head like an old song
She ain't goin' nowhere

She's like standin' in the rain
Washes all my cares away
At the end of a long, hot day
She's like standin' in the rain

She gets on you
Under your skin like a tattoo
She'll always be there
She holds on, stuck in your head like an old song
She ain't goin' nowhere

She gets on you
Under your skin like a tattoo
She'll always be there
She holds on, stuck in your head like an old song
She ain't goin' nowhere

She's like finally coming home
And seeing that light in the window on
After being gone too long
She's like finally coming home
Standin' in the rain
Starin' at the sun"
320,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Laid Back,"Got our headlights circled, Chevrolet
Saturday night at a river bank
Silver bullets popping, got the speakers rocking
A feel good song that'll take you back
Watching them pretty girls work that
Baby, shake it just right, I could do this all night

Out here way back, working on our laid back
Tell everyone you know
Sip it, tip it, pass it around
Let's light up this two lane town
Out here way back, working on our laid back

There's no last call or closing time
Just good stuff passing left and right
Let that homemade hit you
You know I'll be right there with you
Dancing in the dust and half past gone
Turn it up and sing along
No matter what you got playing
Wanna see your body swaying

Out here way back, working on our laid back
Tell everyone you know
Sip it, tip it, pass it around
Let's light up this two lane town
Out here way back, working on our laid back

Out here way back, you can feel that country high
Out here way back, you can do what you want to do tonight

Out here way back, working on our laid back
Tell everyone you know
Sip it, tip it, pass it around
Let's light up this two lane town
Out here way back, working on our laid back"
321,Jason Aldean,Country,6,I Use What I Got,"Nobody ever thought I'd make it in this town
They all said I should leave my truck packed and turn right back around
They said I didn't have what it takes,
I needed money and a pretty face
But I just look at them and say:

I use what I got
Take what I get
Give till I ain't got nothin' left
Then I give it some more
Keep on climbin up that mountain
Keep trucking along
Work up a sweat
Passed every no, after no, after no, till I get a yes.
I'm not worried about what I'm not.
I use what I got.

I still got big dreams and a strong heart,
I got a lot of real good friends who helped me get this far.
I still got a lot of miles to go,
It's a winding uphill road.
But I'll get there the only way I know.

Keep on rollin' along
Doin' my best
Passed every no, after no, after no, till I get a YES!
I don't worry about what I'm not
No, No
I don't worry about what I'm not
I use what I got!"
322,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Ain't No Easy Way,"There ain't no easy way
For me to hear the things you need to say
But go on and say 'em anyway
Baby I can take it

There ain't no easy out
We both know where this is goin' now
Once its rollin' you can't turn around
There ain't no way to fake it

Life is hard but love is harder
And when love won't go any farther
Tears won't put it back together
Sorry don't make it no better
When you run out of ways to stay

There ain't no easy way
To look somebody in the face
And tell them your feelings have changed
And you can't do it anymore
The ain't no easy way
You can try to keep on tryin'
Act like love ain't really dyin'
You can just hang on for so long
You can only be just so strong
When you've run out of ways to stay
There ain't no easy way
For me to hear the things you need to say
But go on and say 'em anyway
Baby I can take it
Baby I can take it

There ain't no easy way"
323,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Whiskey'd Up,"I can twist the top off a 12-pack of longnecks
Get my redneck on baby all night long with the boys
And never even think about you
I can be sittin' with someone new at a table for two
Buzzin' on a bottle of wine and your memory
Ain't messin' up my good time

But when I get whiskey'd up, that wantin' you again
Starts kickin' back in and I'm late night calling you up
My heart starts hurtin' when that bourbon starts burning
And I can't help but touch that stuff
It's just like you all warm and smooth
Even though I know that you don't miss me
It's like you're here with me
When I get whiskey'd up

Every sip I take I can taste your kiss
I feel the fire of your fingertips on my skin
I guess that's why every now and then

I get whiskey'd up, that wantin' you again
Starts kickin' back in and I'm late night calling you up
My heart starts hurtin' when that bourbon starts burning
And I can't help but touch that stuff
It's just like you all warm and smooth
Even though I know that you don't miss me
It's like you're here with me
When I get whiskey'd up

It's a straight shot back to me and you
Yeah when I pour one up
I know just what I'm getting into

When I get whiskey'd up, that wantin' you again
Starts kickin' back in and I'm late night calling you up
My heart starts hurtin' when that bourbon starts burning
And I can't help but touch that stuff
It's just like you all warm and smooth

Ain't come up on your dirt road turn yet
This Chevrolet is 5 away
Just enough time to burn half a cigarette
Can't wait to see what's waitin' on me
Behind that screen door I bet it'll be
Somethin' I can't take my eyes off
Somethin' you can't wait to show off
Baby, this ain't no lay low kinda night I'm talkin' about
When you get everything just the way you like it
Come walkin' out we

Get these wheels rollin' down the road
Find us a couple cold beers to hold
Let that moonlight kiss your skin
Like I'm about to do again and again
Don't matter where we set the party down
Underneath the stars or the lights of town
In a car in a bar girl when this night ends
Let's make it one of the ones we won't forget

You been soakin' up that sunshine all day
Sendin' some hot little pictures my way
Soakin' wet gettin' in my head
Now you're in that dress and girl I can't wait to
Take you out, spin you around
Find somewhere to lay you down
But the first thing we gotta do right now is

Get these wheels rollin' down the road
Find us a couple cold beers to hold
Let that moonlight kiss your skin
Like I'm about to do again and again
Don't matter where we set the party down
Underneath the stars or the lights of town
In a car in a bar girl when this night ends
Let's make it one of the ones we won't forget

325,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Do You Wish It Was Me,"Do you wish it was me?
When the sun slowly chases the moon from the sky
And touches your face as you open your eyes
What are you thinking? Do you like what you see?
Is it all that you dreamed of or do you wish it was me?

Is the life that you chosen free from regret?
Or is what my mind invisions to hard to forget?
Has the glitter all faded? Do you get what you need?
Are you satisfied baby or do you wish it was me?

I know you did what you thought you should do
It was safe and secure so completely thought through
You sacrificed passion and abandoned your dreams


Baby, was it all worth it or do you wish it was me?

Is it closer to the verse or the last?
Is the fire still raging or has it burned down to ash?
Do the memories still haunt you? Do they beg and pled?
Are you satisfied baby or do you wish it was me?

Is the life that you chosen free from regrets?
Or is what my mind in visions to hard to forget?
Has the glitter all faded? Do you get what you need?
Are you satisfied baby or do you wish it was me?
Are you satisfied baby? mm... yeah
Or Do you wish it was me?
Oh, Do you wish it was me?"
326,Jason Aldean,Country,6,See You When I See You,"Let's don't say goodbye
I hate the way it sounds
So, if you don't mind
Let's just say for now

See you when I see you
Another place, some other time
If I ever get down your way
Or you're ever up around mine
We'll laugh about the old days
And catch up on the new
Yeah, I'll see you when I see you
And I hope its some day soon

God made this ol' world round
And maybe it's that way so the paths we go down
Yeah, I will cross again some day
Some day I'll

See you when I see you
Another place, some other time
If I ever get down your way

Or you're ever up around mine
We'll laugh about the old days
And catch up on the new
Yeah, I'll see you when I see you
And I hope its some day real soon

I hope its some day soon

I'll see you when I see you
Another place, some other time
If I ever get down your way
Or you're ever up around mine, just stop by
We'll laugh about the old days
And catch up on the new

I'll see you when I see you"
327,Jason Aldean,Country,6,It Ain't Easy,"I walk a hard line winding road
Don't really know where it's gonna go
Seems like trouble's my best friend
Soon as I get out I'm back in again
It's a wonder I ain't all alone

'Cause it ain't easy, no, it ain't easy
It ain't easy loving me

Don't know why I do the things I do
Must be I love to light the fuse
Stand back and watch it crash and burn and turn into ash
Just like it ain't nothing, she ain't something I could lose

'Cause it ain't easy, no, it ain't easy
It ain't easy loving me

She's the brick by brick that built this house
Without her it would all fall down
Somehow she finds the faith and the strength to believe
Don't know why she sticks around

'Cause it ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy loving me
'Cause it ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy loving me"
328,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Days Like These,"Ain't no cloud up in my sky
I couldn't worry if I tried
I got an open road just darin' me
To pick you up and take you for a ride

I got a new shine on my car
Sun is tannin' my left arm
And while I'm waitin' on the red light 
I'm burnin' up a little air guitar

Turn it up a little bit louder
Turn it up I love this song
Come on girl the world is ours
Let's do something right or wrong

Life is short
Lets go live it
Ain't no time for wasting time
Days like these they go by way too fast

Leave your toe prints on the glass
Sing it like you mean it baby
Close your eyes and lay your head on back

What you say? What was that? Oh

329,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Talk,"You've told me 'bout your family
The town that you grew up in
Believe me, I wanna know everything about you
And I've rambled on about me
By now you know I'm crazy
We could go on all night if we wanted to
But I don't want to

I don't wanna talk anymore
I know enough about you to know all I wanna do is
Find out a little bit more
I don't wanna waste that moon
And the heat on the hood of this Ford
I don't wanna talk anymore

That homemade wine on your lips
My name under your breath
Under one of the best river nights you ever saw
Hey, that says it all

I don't wanna talk anymore
I know enough about you to know all I wanna do is
Find out a little bit more
I don't wanna waste that moon
And the heat on the hood of this Ford
I don't wanna talk anymore

I don't wanna talk
I don't wanna talk anymore
I know enough about you to know all I wanna do is
Find out a little bit more
I don't wanna waste that moon
And the heat on the hood of this Ford
I don't wanna talk anymore
I don't wanna talk anymore"
330,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Not Every Man Lives,"Have you ever skipped a stone across the water
Have you ever hitched a free ride on a train
Have you ever climbed up on a water tower
To write a name

The truth is, Every man dies
Not every man lives

Have you ever loved someone that you would die for
Have you ever walked too far out on a limb
Have you ever chased a dream too high to reach for
And pulled it in

Truth is Every man dies
But Not every man lives

I wanna paint outside the lines
Run the red lights in my mind
Take everything, One lifetime has to give
I wanna stand inside a fire
Walk blind-folded on a wire
Every man dies
But not every man lives



Have you ever thought about how fast time passes
Ever thought about what you would leave behind
Ever stood up for something you believed in
And drawn a line

Truth is every man dies
But not every man lives

I wanna paint outside the lines
Run the red lights in my mind
Take Everything, One lifetime has to give
I wanna stand inside a fire
Walk blind-folded on a wire

Every man Dies
But Not Every Man Lives

I wanna stand inside a fire
Walk Blind-folded on a wire
Every Man Dies
But Not every Man Lives

Have you ever skipped a stone across the water...
Have you ever Hitched a free ride on a train..."
331,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Why,"It's 3 A.M. and I finally say
I'm sorry for actin' that way
I didn't really mean to make you cry
Oh baby, sometimes I wonder why

Does it always have to come down to you leavin'
Before I'll say I love you?
And why do I always use the words that cut the deepest
When I know how much it hurts you?
Oh baby why, do I do that to you?

Well I know I'd never let you walk away
So why do I push you till you break
And why are you always on the verge of good-bye
Before I'll show you how I really feel inside

Why does it always have to come down to you leavin'
Before I'll say I love you?
And why do I always use the words that cut the deepest
When I know how much it hurts you?
Oh baby why, do I do that to you?

Why do I always use the words that cut the deepest
When I know how much it hurts you?
Oh baby why, do I do that to you?
Why do I do that to you?"
332,Jason Aldean,Country,6,They Don't Know,"They call us a two lane just passing by slow down town
Yeah they say what's there to do when you ain't got nothin' around
Just a few street lights, speed limit signs that all say 25
But those folks ain't lived in our lives

They ain't seen the blood sweat and tears it took to live their dreams
When everything's on the line
Ain't just another field, just another farm
No, it's the ground we grew up on
They think it's a middle of nowhere place where we take it slow
Aw but they don't know

All they see is tractors, barbwire and tall green grass
They don't see the years spent working, busting their ass
How they pray for rain
They don't know a thing
About what it takes
Livin' this way

They ain't seen the blood sweat and tears it took to live their dreams
When everything's on the line
Ain't just another field, just another farm
No, it's the ground we grew up on
They think it's a middle of nowhere place where we take it slow
Aw but they don't know
No, they don't know

They call us a two lane just passing by slow down town
Yeah they say what's there to do when you ain't got nothin' around

No, they don't know"
333,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Show You Off,"We can go around, club hopping
Tell you all I want to do is drop in
Have a drink and catch a good band
Couple songs and, hey, we're gone again
Act like that's all we're doing, the truth is...

I just wanna show you off
Drive 'em all crazy,
Watch all the boys hate me
Is that so wrong? Come on
I just want the world to see how lucky I am
You're so fine girl, damn,
Be all I ever saw
I just want to show you off

Maybe take a ride down Broadway
All the Dodges and the Fords and the Chevrolets
Slow rolling, looking over and
Girl, you've got that super cab glowing
Roll down that tinted window
There you go.

I just wanna show you off
Drive 'em all crazy,
Watch all the boys hate me
Is that so wrong? Come on
I just want the world to see how lucky I am
You're so fine girl, damn,
Be all I ever saw,
I just want to show you off

(Come on, girl)

Might look like we're just cruising, truth is, truth is...

I just wanna show you off
Drive 'em all crazy,
Watch all the boys hate me
Is that so wrong? Come on
I just want the world to see how lucky I am
You're so fine girl, damn,
Be all I ever saw
I just wanna show you off
I just wanna show you off"
334,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Even If I Wanted To,"I'm on the brink
I can barely think
With all of these thoughts
Running through my head
Wonderin' if I did you wrong
No way, I did you wrong

Every night, I try to justify
All the angry things I said
Oh but I can't take 'em back
No I can't do that
I was wrong, oh but now you're gone

I can't hide what I feel inside
And just stop lovin' you
Even if I wanted to
I can't hold on
But lettin' go
Is something I can't do, is something I can't do
Even if I wanted to

All the times I sat and watched you cry
When I should have held you close
Made sure that you know
How much I cared
But I was never there
I was wrong
And now you've moved on

I can't hide what I feel inside
And just stop lovin' you
Even if I wanted to
I can't hold on
But lettin' go
Is something I can't do, is something I can't do
Even if I wanted to

Even if I wanted to

I can't hide what I feel inside
And just stop lovin' you
Even if I wanted to
I can't hold on
But lettin' go
Is something I can't do, is something I can't do
Even if I wanted to

Even if I wanted to"
335,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Just Passing Through,"I can hear that rooster crowing down the road
I felt my eyes open up real slow
And I looked around
Makin' sure I hadn't checked out
'Cause there was an angel lyin' next to me
And I figured heaven's where I must be 
Oh, but it was you 
And baby, what else could I do? 
In that bed, I said a little prayer 
For one more day I'm still here

It's your world and I'm just in it
Ain't no other way to spin it
Lucky me, just being there when I get to hold you
I'm just here to love you, girl
It's your world, and I'm just passing through

I dig in my heels and try to slow this down
I want my life to revolve around everything you do
Oh, but that's all up to you
Everything good seems to go so fast 
It's kinda like one big party crash
You weren't counting on 
One day you're here and gone
Baby, all I wanna do is lay right here 
And hope it all don't disappear

It's your world and I'm just in it
Ain't no other way to spin it
Lucky me, just being there when I get to hold you
I'm just here to love you, girl
It's your world, and I'm just passing through

It's your world and I'm just in it
Ain't no other way to spin it
Lucky me, just being there when I get to hold you
I'm just here to love you, girl
It's your world, and I'm just passing through"
336,Jason Aldean,Country,6,You're the Love I Wanna Be In,"I've always been there every time he let you down
I caught your falling tears before they hit the ground
But I just heard somebody say that you finally told him goodbye
Well girl now you've finally made your move
Now I'm here to make mine...

I want to be there when you wake up, be more than just your friend
Baby there's no mistaking you're the love I wanna be in

I've kept my feelings under lock and key
Couldn't let you see them even though it was killing me
You can't imagine all the time I spent wishing you were mine
I just know if we ever kissed we'd go crazy baby for the rest of our lifes

I want to be there when you wake up, be more than just your friend
Baby there's no mistaking you're the love I wanna be in!

Well I want to be there when you wake up
Be more than just your friend
Baby there's no mistaking you're the love I wanna be in!

I wanna be there when you wake up, be more than just your friend
Baby there's no mistaking, you're the love I wanna be in!
You're the love I wanna be in!
Oh yeah

I wanna be there when you wake up..."
337,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Relentless,"I toss and turn, I'm losing sleep
Can't seem to make any sense of anything
I keep wandering around in circles, in a daze
Just when I start awakening
I find that something's intoxicating me
Till I'm tangled up, lost inside a maze

I can't outrun it
Just keeps comin'
Girl, your love is relentless

Just like the waves against the sand
Over and over and time and time again
Your love keeps on reaching out to me

I can't outrun it
Just keeps comin'
Girl, your love is relentless
I can't fight it
There's no hiding
Girl, your love is relentless

I'm staring at a hurricane
A hundred miles of driving rain
I just smile and lean into the wind
'Cause I can't outrun it

I can't outrun it
Just keeps comin'
Girl, your love is relentless
I can't fight it
There's no hiding
Girl, your love is relentless

I toss and turn, I'm losing sleep
Can't seem to make any sense of anything
I keep wandering around in circles, in a daze
Just when I start awakening
I find that something's intoxicating me
Till I'm tangled up, lost inside a maze"
338,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Lonesome USA,"I drove half way to town last night
And I turned around
In a field of fireflies makin' such a lonely sound
As my headlights flashed on a mailbox by the road
I realized that I was livin' in a new zip code

Well I'm livin' in Lonesome USA
Population one since yesterday
Livin' and dyin' in the hell I made
Since you been gone
Right now my mind's in another state
Ain't enough heart here left to break
I'm livin' in Lonesome, Lonesome USA

I never knew the sound of silence could be so loud
It's hard getting used to livin' in an empty house
Yeah I know I can come and go any time I please
But there's somethin' I miss about
You waitin' up on me

Well I'm livin' in Lonesome USA
Population one since yesterday
Livin' and dyin' in the hell I made
Since you been gone
Right now my mind's in another state
Ain't enough heart here left to break
I'm livin' in Lonesome, Lonesome USA

Hey I could drive all night
And be right here where I am
And still be just as lost till you come back
Hey I look around here an it don't take long to see
Oh where I am right now's the only place to be

Lonesome USA
Population one since yesterday
Livin' and dyin' in the hell I made
Since you been one
Right now my mind's in another state
Ain't enough heart here left to break
I'm livin' in Lonesome, Lonesome USA
Hey I'm livin' in Lonesome, Lonesome USA
Hey I'm livin' in Lonesome, Lonesome USA"
339,Jason Aldean,Country,6,All Out of Beer,"If you'd a got here 'fore my buzz kicked in
I'd a told you where to go, I'd a never let you in
Crashed out on the couch waitin' on that sun to come up
I'd probably still be hating on you
Saying I'm just glad it's over, actin' like that was the truth
I'd still have my walls, girl, I wouldn't care at all

So why you gotta wait until I'm gone to come around
When I ain't got no fight left I got no way out
When I'm 12 in, helpless
The only time you show up here is when you're lonely
And I'm all out of beer

I wish that you'd go find somebody new
And I wish I had it in me, to just have one or two
I wish I could draw a line, stick to it just one time
But I'm drunk tonight, so never mind

So why you gotta wait until I'm gone to come around
When I ain't got no fight left I got no way out
When I'm 12 in, helpless
The only time you show up here is when you're lonely
And I'm all out of beer

You got me where you want me girl, no I can't stand it
Looks like tonight's gonna go just the way you planned it

So why you gotta wait until I'm gone to come around
When I ain't got no fight left I got no way out
When I'm 12 in, helpless
The only time you show up here
Is when I'm 12 in, helpless
Girl you know I'm gonna give in
When you're lonely
And I'm all out of beer
When you're lonely
And I'm all out of beer"
340,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Church Pew or Bar Stool,"Not a whole lot going on, a small town Friday night
Revving up at a red light, on your mark get set go
Past a mom and pop restaurant
Same four trucks parked out front
I guess you gotta make your own fun
When you're stuck in a place this slow

There's only two means of salvation
Around here that seem to work
Whiskey or the Bible, a shot glass or revival

When you don't seem to run on either side of the fence
People act like you don't make sense
These big town dreams that I've been chasing
Will never come true if I wind up staying
And I don't want to fall in, the same rut
That everybody here seems to be stuck in now
Why do I hang around 
In this church pew or bar stool kind of town

I'm like that AM station, that never comes in right
'Til you pass the city limit sign, that's the only time it
All gets clear
Well it's crystal clear that I, just need to find
A place where there is no lines
And nothing like it is around here

Someplace where it don't feel like this 
World revolves around 
Whiskey or the Bible, a shot glass or revival

When you don't seem to run on either side of the fence
People act like you don't make sense
These big town dreams that I've been chasing
Will never come true if I wind up staying
And I don't want to fall in, the same rut
That everybody here seems to be stuck in now
Why do I hang around 
In this church pew or bar stool kind of town

Here it sometimes feels just like this 
World revolves around 
Whiskey or the Bible, a shot glass or revival

When you don't seem to run on either side of the fence
People act like you don't make sense
These big town dreams that I've been chasing
Will never come true if I wind up staying
And I don't want to fall in, the same rut
That everybody here seems to be stuck in now
Why do I hang around 
In this church pew or bar stool kind of town

Yeah I need to get out, of this church pew or bar stool kind of town"
341,Jason Aldean,Country,6,This Nothin' Town,"Got us a sunset sinking into a Friday night
Got us some beer needs drinking hey and we just might
Sometimes we gotta make it up as we go
But layin' low ain't all that goes on 'round here

It might look a little laid back to ya
But it ain't all just porches and plows
But don't let that one red light fool ya
There's always something going down
In this nothing town

That old abandoned factory just got the wrecking ball
We threw a party in the parking lot just to watch it fall
Sometimes we gotta make it up as we go
But laying low ain't all that goes on round here

It might look a little laid back to ya
But it ain't all just porches and plows
But don't let that one red light fool ya
There's always something going down
In this nothing town
In this nothing town

Somebody's backyard
Some river bank
Sometimes c'mon y'all
Yeah that's all it takes

It might look a little laid back to ya
But it ain't all just porches and plows
But don't let that one red light fool ya
There's always something going down

342,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Rearview Town,"Wipe the footprints off my dash
Tore up those sun-faded photographs
Threw 'em in the wind, y'all can have it back
I'm outta here
I stuck my middle finger up in the sky
Flipped off that ""y'all come back"" sign
Looked in the mirror one last time
And watched it disappear

It ain't nothin' but a rearview town
Broken hearts and rusted plows
Roots ripped right up out of the ground
Never thought I'd ever leave it
It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town

I could tough it out, but what's the use?
A place that small, it's hard to do
Too much of her to run into
And so much road to somewhere new

It ain't nothin' but a rearview town
Broken hearts and rusted plows
Roots ripped right up out of the ground
Never thought I'd ever leave it
It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town

It ain't nothin' but yesterday
One less truck rollin' down Main
Ain't nothin' left to say

It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town"

Girl, you know those rumors get to flyin' in a town this size
No, I didn't feel a thing when you threw that ring and slammed the door
If you wanna know the truth you gotta go straight to the source

Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown the thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool

I can finally stretch out in our king size bed if I make it that far
But fillin' in all these blanks you left isn't all that hard
No, I ain't wonderin' where you been or who you been with
I guess you didn't hurt me half as bad as you think you did

Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown the thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool

Yeah, you think I'm down and out, hidin' out, hell-bent crazy
But that ain't me, baby

Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my coke now
But I'm a long way from broke down
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone

Slide over, well slip out to the outskirts of town
Got a blanket and a fifth of comfort
A little something to knock off the edge
It's supposed to get a little cool tonight
Looks like I'm gonna have to hold you tight... yeah

'Bout a mile off old mill road
In that spot nobody knows
Park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up, girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
Sound of steel and old box cars

Come on baby lets go listen to the night train

Yeah I hope it's gonna be a long one
If were lucky its moving slow
Wouldn't mind if it lasted all night
Lying next to you on that hillside lets go

I walked around the town square
Down the street to where
I met the preacher and the old courthouse man
Yeah, nothing helps you start again like

Old boots, new dirt, no reminders
I've got a feeling this town will get me over her
You've been through what I've been through, man
Nothing feels better than old boots, new dirt

There's a thousand faces that I ain't seen before
The only history that I can see is from the civil war
It's good for me to look around
Go down roads she ain't been down
No memories of our ""used to bes"" set me free

Old boots, new dirt, no reminders
I've got a feeling this town will get me over her
You've been through what I've been through, man
Nothing feels better than old boots, new dirt

Old boots, new dirt, one step closer
Yeah, I think I'm gonna like it here, yeah

348,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Country Boy's World,"She was raised up in Jersey
I said oh Lord have mercy
Never seen a one light town till she moved down here
She said I'm so bored out of my mind
Need a Starbucks and a wifi
Or a jet airliner to fly me anywhere
I said do you wanna take a drive in my truck
Don't pay no mind to that 12 point buck
Laid across my hood
You ever been to

Rome Georgia
Picked peaches off the trees
Climbed the water tower in Paris Tennessee
Been to Florence Alabama
Drank muscadine wine
Just give me a chance to change your mind
So before you go and fly away girl
Let me show you 'round a country boy's world

Somewhere between there on a dirt road
When I rolled down my window
She smelled the scent of wildflowers on the summer wind
With just a bite of homeade ice cream
And a glass of Momma's sweet tea
This ol' holler's got a way of makin' friends
She'd never seen a glowin' field of fireflies
Or the twinkle of a star in a southern sky

She fell in love
We went down to

Rome Georgia
Picked peaches off the trees
Climbed the water tower in Paris Tennessee
Went to Florence Alabama
Drank muscadine wine
She gave me a chance and I made her mine
Says she'll never fly away and she's my girl
It's 'cause I showed her 'round a country boy'd world

Ooh now she's riding shotgun
Sayin' baby let's run wild
And go down to

Rome Georgia
Pick peaches off the trees
Climb the water tower in Paris Tennessee
Goto Florence Alabama
Drink muscadine wine
She gave me a chance and I made her mine
Says she'll never fly away and she's my girl
It's 'cause I showed her 'round a country boy's world"

There's just one thing missing baby right about now

I need a sweet little something like you got
Standing there red hot, tied up little tank top
Looking like you must be straight out of the country
Honey, what I wouldn't do for a sweet little something like you

I see you dancing over there with your girlfriends
Got your fine self showing off that sun tan
You keep smiling that smile at me
Like you're reading my mind and you know

I need a sweet little something like you got
Standing there red hot, tied up little tank top
Looking like you must be straight out of the country
Honey, what I wouldn't do for a sweet little something like you

I need a sweet little something like you girl
Sliding into my world
Yeah, I've been needing it all night
Slow county just right, honey suckle sweet little something

I need a sweet little something like you got
Standing there red hot, tied up little tank top
Looking like you must be straight out of the country
Honey, what I wouldn't do for a sweet little something

Sweet little something like you got
Standing there red hot, tied up little tank top
Looking like you must be straight out of the country
Honey, what I wouldn't do for a sweet little something like you

Ride you around in my old truck
Keep you out until the sun comes up
Girl you got that serious
Sweet little something like you
The way you fly yeah across that seat
Looking so damn good to me
Hey little girl right now
I need a sweet little something like you

Ride you around in my old truck
Keep you out until the sun comes up
Girl you got that serious
Sweet little something like you
The way you fly yeah across that seat
Looking so damn good to me
Hey little girl right now
I need a sweet little something like you"
350,Jason Aldean,Country,6,When She Says Baby,"Somedays it's tough just gettin' up
Throwin' on these boots and makin' that climb
Somedays, I'd rather be a no-show, lay low 
Before I go outta my mind

But when she says baby, (baby)
Oh, no matter what comes, I ain't goin' nowhere 
She runs her fingers through my hair and saves me (saves me)
Yeah, that look in her eyes got me comin' alive 
And drivin' me a good kinda crazy 
When she says baby
Oh, when she says baby

Some nights, I come home fightin' mad 
Feel like runnin' my fist through the wall
Is it even worth what I'm fightin' for anymore, 
Feelin' torn all the hell with it all

But when she's says baby, (baby)
Oh, no matter what comes, I ain't goin' nowhere 
She runs her fingers through my hair and saves me (saves me)
Yeah, that look in her eyes got me comin' alive 
And drivin' me a good kinda crazy
When she says baby

Everything gonna be alri-i-ight!
Just lay down by my si-i-ide!
Let me love you through this li-i-i-i-ife!

Yeah, she's a perfect shot of faith
When every bit of mine is gone
Somethin' I could believe in, a best friend 
And heaven's sent a love to lean on

But when she's says baby, (baby)
Oh, no matter what comes, I ain't goin' nowhere 
She runs her fingers through my hair and saves me (saves me)
Yeah, that look in her eyes got me comin' alive 
And drivin' me a good kinda crazy

When she says baby

Oh, when she says baby

Yeah, that look in her eyes got me comin' alive 
And drivin' me a good kinda crazy"
351,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Wheels Rollin',"Counting the lines on a highway road
Mile one by one
Flying through the midnight rain
Like a bullet from a gun

I lay down but I can't sleep
'Cause I still feel the band
Still on a high from the crowd in the lights
With a cold one in my hand

Singing
Here I go, down this road
Another town, another state
I wouldn't have it any other way
All I want, is to sing my songs
Hearing that crowd, keeps me going
Guitars rocking, wheels rolling

I step up, the lights go down
I hear that first chord ring
It's where I go to lose myself
Forget about everything

It's my home away from home
Hanging with my friends
It's a crazy life, but every night
I get to do it again and again and again

Here I go, down this road
Another town, another state
I wouldn't have it any other way
All I want, is to sing my songs
Hearing that crowd, keeps me going
Guitars rocking, wheels rolling

Here I go, down this road
Another town, another state
I wouldn't have it any other way
All I want, is to sing my songs
Hearing that crowd, keeps me going
Guitars rocking, wheels rolling

Here I go
On down this road
Don't you know
I wouldn't have it any other way"
352,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Comin' In Hot,"I usually tell you take your time
Go 45, ease in your drive
I put it in park, come inside
While you get ready
We lay it back, we take it slow
We put the night on cruise control
Whatcha wanna do, where you wanna go
I don't care baby
Been fixin' fence, been runnin' roads
Missing you like crazy
Girl, when I come to town tonight
I'm comin' in hot

Already got your song on
When you climb in it'll be playin'
Been thinking 'bout you all week long
Oh baby don't keep me waiting
You've got about 45 minutes tops
'Fore I roll in there ready to rock
Comin' to get some of what you got
Girl I'm comin' in hot
I'm comin' in hot

Girl I already stopped by the store
Can in a koozie sittin' in your door
Cooler in the back if you want some more
No, I ain't playin'
You'll love the spot that I picked out
Where the stars and the moon come shining down
Won't be anybody else around, look out
I'm comin' in hot

Already got your song on
When you climb in it'll be playin'
Been thinking 'bout you all week long
Oh baby don't keep me waiting
You've got about 45 minutes tops
'Fore I roll in there ready to rock
Comin' to get some of what you got
Girl I'm comin' in hot
I'm comin' in hot

Like a summer black top
Like a 30 ought shot
Like I'm runnin' from the cops
To get to you girl
Like these 35 tires
Just caught on fire
Baby ready or not
I'm comin' in hot

Already got your song on
When you climb in it'll be playin'
Been thinking 'bout you all week long

353,Jason Aldean,Country,6,When the Lights Go Out,"I gotta get to you baby, I gotta get to you now
Without you I'm going crazy, without you girl I'm going wild
The only thing that I wanna do is fall into you

Baby when the lights go out
I wanna hear that want you sound
On your lips when I lay you down (down down down)
I wanna love you 'til there's nothing left
All night until the sky turns red
Do everything that we ain't done yet
But we been thinkin' about
Baby when the lights go out
Baby when the lights go out

A day can feel like forever, baby when you're not around
Yeah when we ain't together, you're all I dream about
I'm turning corners I'm driving, over to your house

Baby when the lights go out
I wanna hear that want you sound
On your lips when I lay you down (down down down)
I wanna love you 'til there's nothing left
All night until the sky turns red

354,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Amarillo Sky,"He gets up before the dawn
Packs a lunch an' a thermos full o' coffee
It's another day in the dusty haze
Those burnin' rays are wearin' down his body
The diesel's worth the price of gold
It's the cheapest grain he's ever sold
But he's still holdin' on

He just takes the tractor another round
An' pulls the plow across the ground
And sends up another prayer
He says: ""Lord, I never complain, I never ask 'Why?'
Please don't let my dreams run dry
Underneath, underneath this Amarillo Sky""

That hail storm back in '83
Sure did take a toll on his family
But he stayed strong and carried on
Just like his Dad and Granddad did before him
On his knees every night
He prays: ""Please let my crops and children grow""
'Cause that's all he's ever known

He just takes the tractor another round
An' pulls the plow across the ground
And sends up another prayer
He says: ""Lord, I never complain, I never ask 'Why?'
Please don't let my dreams run dry
Underneath, underneath this Amarillo Sky""

An' he takes the tractor another round (Another round)
Another round (Another round)
Another round
An' he takes the tractor another round, another round
He says: ""I never complain, I never ask 'Why?'
Please don't let my dreams run dry
Underneath, underneath this Amarillo Sky
Underneath this Amarillo Sky"""
355,Jason Aldean,Country,6,She Loved Me,"It was the summer of '89, I fell in love and I learned to drive
Me and Becky didn't waste no time, went zero to 65 one night
Being young was getting old, we were heading down a dead end road
But we didn't care, we were on a roll. Hanging on for the ride
Those lines that we were crossing, carelessly tossing caution to the wind,
Were wearing thin.

We were living for the minute, loving every second of it
Fearless, wild, and free!
Nothing could stop us but one day time caught up with us
And woke us up in the middle of our dream, but not before she loved me.

She loved me.

I think we thought that it would last, but looking back I had to laugh
What a mess we made of that, now I'm not sure that I would want it back
We learned a little bit about love, what it wasn't and what it was
It was fast and it was fun, the beginning of the end of us

One day that road just ran out, but I still travel down it now and then
And once again...

We're living for the minute, loving every second of it
Fearless, wild, and free!
Nothing could stop us but one day time caught up with us
And woke us up in the middle of our dream, but not before she loved me.

We were living for the minute, loving every second of it
Fearless (fearless) wild, and free!
Nothing could stop us but one day time caught up with us
And woke us up in the middle of our dream, but not before she loved me.

She loved me.
She loved me."
356,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Good to Go,"Waitin' at a stop light yesterday
As a funeral procession made its way
Through the gates
I watched it roll up a winding road
Through a field of green
With white headstones
All in a row
And it made me think about where I'm at
On my not so straight and narrow path
All the generous and mostly undeserved
Blessings that I've had

I had an all-American mom and dad
Some of the coolest friends you could ever have
Found love I thought I'd never find
Sometimes I can't believe this life in mine
And I'm not plannin' on leavin' yet
But the truth is you just never know
And if this is as good as it gets
Man, I think I'm good to go
I'm good to go

I said a prayer for the dearly departed
And the loved ones left broken hearted
Then traffic started
And I drove away a little more able
To see the good things on my table
And for that I'm grateful
'Cause I've had my troubles and my trials
I've hit the mark and I've missed by miles
Had days that I've been fightin' mad
But the good times have more than
Outweighted the bad

Got to hold my newborn baby girl
And the hand of a man as he slipped from this world
I've laughed so hard I couldn't stop
Seen the sunrise from a mountain top
And I'm not plannin' on leavin' yet
But the truth is you just never know
And if this is as good as it gets
Man, I think I'm good to go

Yeah, I've been thinkin' bout where I'm at
On my not so straight and narrow path
And I wouldn't wanna change nothing about
This roll with the punches life I've had

Had an all-American mom and dad
Some of the coolest friends you could ever have
Found love I thought I'd never find
I can't believe this life in mine
And I'm not plannin' on leavin' yet
But the truth is you just never know
And if this is as good as it gets
Man, I think I'm good to go
I'm good to go
I'm good to go"
357,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Keep the Girl,"This life is full of choices,
Hard to make one all the voices,
In my head,
Those blue eyes I'm in love with,
Or that highway which ever I pick,
There'll be regrets,
I go one way I lose everything,
I go the other way same thing,

I'm torn and it's tearing me apart,
I want to go but I don't want to break her heart,
Like a sword with a double edge blade,
It's gonna cut deep either way,
This little town that big old world,
Chase the dream or keep the girl,

More than once I packed it all up,
But I break down blame it on the truck,
Just couldn't go,
Just wanna be out there making my mark,
Lay down every night in her arms,

I don't know why I can't have it all,
Need to tear down that wall,
Between this little town that big old world,
Go chase my dream and keep the girl,

I'm torn and it's tearing me apart,
I want to go but I don't want to break her heart,
Like a sword with a double edge blade,
It's gonna cut deep either way,
This little town that big old world,
Go chase my dream and keep the girl,

I want it all,
Keep the girl,"
358,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Don't Change Gone,"I can keep on changing the song
Keep on changing stations
Till I finally land on one
I don't mind that they keep playing
I'd take a different road through town
I find another way around
Change it up, really shake it up
Yeah, I'm trying

But it don't change gone, won't bring her back
She's moved on, and I'm stuck with that
I could change whatever I want
But it don't change gone

I could keep on hanging around
But I don't see me staying
Strike a match and burn it down
Walk out and leave it laying
Don't think about a thing just drive
Far enough till I find a change of scene
A new routine, I'll try anything

But it don't change gone, won't bring her back
She's moved on, and I'm stuck with that
I could change whatever I want
But it don't change

Taillights fading, not once breaking
She's gone

Yeah, I could change whatever I want
But it don't change gone
No it don't change gone"
359,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Fast,"Goodbye crack of dawn,
Goodbye harvester,
And goodbye hello baby,
After a long hard day,
Of plowing dirt,

Goodbye way of life,
Goodbye pass it down,
Goodbye up all night,
Of praying for rain,
A two year drought,
Walking on faith,
And toughing it out,

Hey,
What's past is past,
Oh,
Nothing in this world lasts,
Hey,
Aren't those four lanes,
Fast,

Goodbye gravel road,
Thanks for the ride,
For watching over me,
Remember the time,
I rolled my truck,
And you were there,
When I woke up,
You walked me home,
Yeah you lead me home

Goodbye,
Tomorrows another day,
In no time,
It only moves one way,
Away from yesterday,
Oh memories never fade,

Aren't they fast,
What's past is past,
Aren't they fast,"
360,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Gonna Know We Were Here,"You got the gas
I got the matches
We gonna turn this town to ashes
'Cause they ain't never seen nothing like us
Ain't heard loud till we turn it up
I got the wild
You got the crazy
You know that's why I love you baby
Cause your moaning runs just as fast as mine
Little to the middle, keep your throttle down all night
And we only get one life

Ain't scared to ride this train
Make a few marks, leave a few stains
My slam is a little too hard
Might take it just a little to far
My burn, I like it fire
Like a shooting star across the sky
And we may not be around in 20 years but the show gonna we were here
Yeah, the show gonna we were here

People talk girl
You know that well
When they got a good tale to tell
Let's give them something they ain't never seen
A little rated R red-neck dream
Let's play the trail through the dirty south
Or give them something they can talk about
A little story that they won't forget
Long after we ride on to the sunset
Baby, 'cause we ain't there yet, baby

Ain't scared to ride this train
Make a few marks, leave a few stains
My slam is a little too hard
Might take it just a little to far
My burn, I like it fire
Like a shooting star across the sky
And we may not be around in 20 years but the show gonna we were here
Yeah, the show gonna we were here

We only get a chance around
This runaway rollercoaster train
And it ain't slowing down
So baby let go and remember our name

Ain't scared to ride this train
Make a few marks, leave a few stains
My slam is a little too hard
Might take it just a little to far
My burn, I like it fire
Like a shooting star across the sky
And we may not be around in 20 years but the show gonna we were here
Yeah, the show gonna we were here"
361,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Laughed Until We Cried,"Going through my closet the other day
Found an old yearbook, flipped right to the page
Of that senior trip down there on that Panama strip
We all started yelling when we smelled the beach
Just couldn't wait to try our fake ids
We only had a few days, and a whole lot of memories to make
Oh man we were livin', didn't waste one minute
We talked and drank and danced and said goodbye
We laughed until we cried

This past year my family
Was sittin' cross-legged 'round the Christmas tree
Listenin to granddad, we all knew it would probably be his last
He was crackin' jokes and we were takin' turns
Tellin' stories bout fishing or lessons learned
Out on the porch with him we all felt like kids again

Oh man we were livin', sittin' there reminiscin'
Yeah, we sang and talked and traveled back in time


We laughed until we cried

It's like the best days under the sun
Every emotion rolled into one
A little of this, A little of that
Kinda happy, Kinda sad

Just the other night the baby was cryin
So I got out of bed rocked her awhile and I held her tight
And I told her it would be all right
My mind went back to a few years ago
We tried so long, we almost gave up hope
And I remember you comin' in and tellin' me the news
Oh man we were livin', goin' crazy in the kitchen
We danced and screamed and held each other tight
We laughed until we cried
(Although, the CD cover says Oh man were livin' I'll never forget it,
We danced and kissed and thanked the Lord that night)"
362,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Asphalt Cowboy,"The sun has opened up my eyes
And I don't want to leave your side
For that lonesome road
But here I go
Climbing back behind the wheel of
50 feet of chrome and steel and a load
They need in Chicago
Through the middle of the night unknown
I'm on a ride that won't let me go

I'm an asphalt cowboy
Born to run underneath the stars
Pay no mind to my lonely heart
I just ride, ride
Till I'm back in your arms again
I'll be out here on the wind

Sometimes late at night
I see you picture by the dashboard light
And it takes me
Where I'd like to be
Wrapped up in a blanket there
Pulling ribbons from you hair and your kiss
Girl that's what I miss
Still I drive there horses throught the rain and snow
This high-speed rodeo is all I know

I'm an asphalt cowboy
Born to run underneath the stars
Pay no mind to my lonely heart
I just ride, ride
Till I'm back in your arms again
I'll be out here on the wind

And I'll ride
Till I'm back in your arms again
I'll be out here on the wind
And I'll ride
Through the middle of the night unknown
I'm on a ride that won't let me go"
363,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Feel That Again,"A river in July, two kids on summer break,
Another record high, clothes scattered on the bank.
The rush of jumpin' in, I wanna feel that again.

Sun going down, build a fire in the dirt
You're dancing all around wearing my t-shirt,
The way you pull me in, I wanna feel that again

Guitar comin' through the speakers,
That song you never wanna end,
Gimme some of that you and me,
Some of that way back when,
A little bit of wild and free
I wanna feel that again

Nothin' but a blur, gravel road, a flatbed Ford
Always was the cure, ooh whenever we got bored,
Sideways round the bend, yeah I wanna feel that again.

Guitar comin' through the speakers,
That song you never wanna end,
Gimme some of that you and me,
Some of that way back when,
A little bit of wild and free
I wanna feel that again

Guitar comin' through the speakers,
That song you never wanna end,
Gimme some of that you and me,
Some of that way back when,
A little bit of wild and free
I wanna feel that again
Feel that again"
364,Jason Aldean,Country,6,If She Could See Me Now,"There wasn't a stone I didn't throw
When I wrecked it
My foolish words so cruel and cold
Were disconnected

Tell me why, when she cried
All I did was close my eyes

But if she could see me now
If she could see me breaking down
Maybe she'd turn around
If she could see me now

Now the sunshine feels like rain
Trying to drown me
And the world feels out of place
All around me

So I wait and I pray
That I'll run into her someday

But if she could see me now
If she could see me breaking down
Maybe she'd turn around
If she could see me now

There's so many things
I wish I could tell her, show her
Just how bad I really need her
Miss her, love her

But if she could see me now
If she could see me breaking down
Maybe she'd turn around
If she could see me now

But if she could see me now
If she could see me breaking down
Maybe she'd turn around
If she could see me now

If she could see me now"
365,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Grown Woman,"Pain
It's only a little pain, 
It'll be gone in a couple o' days, 
Or maybe a life or two, 
Heart 
It's only my poor heart, 
Just that little thing you tore apart, 
It ain't no headline news.

But a grown woman
Should've known better 
Than to treat me like some old lipstick 
You use up and throw away, 
Hey, hey, hey

Time, 
I wish I could turn back time, 
To when you were just a child, 
And teach you a thing or two about love,
It's okay if you wanna give up, 
But there's a way to leave someone, 
And You Don't Have To Be So Cruel.

'Cause a grown woman 
Should've known better 
Then to treat me like some old dishrag 
You use up and throw away 
Hey, hey, hey

You're supposed to treat your lover 
At least as good as your neighbor, 
So how could you, a grown woman 
Not know better.

I ain't no old lipstick 
You use up And throw away, 
When you're ready for another shade 
Hey, hey, hey, 
You should've known better, 
'Cause you're a grown woman."
366,Jason Aldean,Country,6,The Only Way I Know (with Luke Bryan & Eric Church),"Well I grew up in one of them old farm towns
Where they hit it hard till the sun goes down
Nobody really seemed to care that we were living in the middle of nowhere
We just figured that's how it was
And everybody else was just like us
Soaking in the rain baking in the sun
Don't quit till the job gets done

That's the only way I know
Don't stop till everything's gone
Straight ahead never turn round
Don't back up, don't back down

Full throttle wide open
You get tired, you don't show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you can't dig no more
That's the only way I know

That old red dirt the first thing you learn
You don't get nothing that you don't earn
Humble pride that I grew up on
You find out just how bad you want it

Sun in our eyes backs to the fences
Didn't know the odds were against us
Hit the wall smoking and spinning
Still wasn't thinking 'bout nothing but winning

That's the only way I know
Don't stop till everything's gone
Straight ahead never turn round
Don't back up, don't back down

Full throttle wide open
You get tired, you don't show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you can't dig no more
That's the only way I know

Maybe there's another path that will get you there a little bit faster,
But I'm sticking with the one inside of me.

That's the only way I know
Don't stop till everything's gone
Straight ahead never turn round
Don't back up, don't back down

Full throttle wide open
You get tired, you don't show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you can't dig no more
That's the only way I know"
367,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Reason to Love L.A.,"I'm about as small town as you can get 
I'm talkin' two lanes one cop
Plowed up fields catching red sunsets 
We get nervous when the rain stops 
Never had a reason to leave this place 
Never had a reason to get away

The wheels just touched down in California 
Man I don't even like to fly 
I just gotta see her with the sun shining on her in the water 
Chrome aviators on her eyes 

I never had a reason to get away 
I never had a reason to see this place 
She gave me a reason to love L.A.

She said she had to be where that sun dropped down 
I'm talkin' fast lane goodbye 
She'd chase it all the way till that road ran out 
And parked it underneath the pink sky 
I wanna hear those waves come crashing in
I wanna feel that sand and that wind 
I wanna go everywhere she's been, hold her again

The wheels just touched down in California 
Man I don't even like to fly 
I just gotta see her with the sun shining on her in the water 
Chrome aviators on her eyes 

I never had a reason to get away 
I never had a reason to see this place...

The wheels just touched down in California 
Man I don't even like to fly 
I just gotta see her with the sun shining on her in the water 
Chrome aviators on her eyes

I never had a reason to see this place 
She gave me a reason to love L.A."
368,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Don't Give up on Me,"I don't go to church enough,
I curse out loud I drink too much,
I'm more of a sinner than a saint,
Gotta dusty bible on my shelf,
I just pick it up when I need help,
Lord knows there's a lot I need to change,
And I want to baby you make me want to,

You tie the knot when I'm at the end of my rope,
You never stop believing in me when I don't know,
Who I am or what I'm supposed to be,
I don't give you no good reasons,
But baby don't give up on me,

I've smoked my last cigarette,
At least a hundred times I bet,
I guess I'll just keep quitting till it sticks,
But for all the things I've failed to do,
I've never failed at loving you,
We both know I can't grant your every wish,
But I want to baby you make me want to,"
369,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Tonight Looks Good On You,"You ain't got a dress that I don't like
You ain't got a pair of jeans that don't fit you just right
There's not a minute in the day
That you don't knock me out, you don't blow me away
But girl, now that the sun is going down
Looking at you right and now, baby

Somethin' about that southern sky sitting back behind that blur
It goes perfect with your eyes
Girl, tonight looks good on you
It's something about the way you're smiling
Making the stars go round on you
I just gotta tell you baby
Tonight looks good on you

I can taste the midnight on your lips
Makes me just wanna lean in for another kiss
Wind blowing your hair around
Girl it makes me want to let you down
You've been beautiful a million times
But I've never seen you looking like this no

Somethin' about that southern sky sitting back behind that blur
It goes perfect with your eyes
Girl, tonight looks good on you
It's something about the way you're smiling
Making the stars go round on you
I just gotta tell you baby
Tonight looks good on you

Looks so good on your skin
I don't ever, no I never, I don't ever, ever want to give up, baby

Somethin' about that southern sky sitting back behind that blur
It goes perfect with your eyes
Girl, tonight looks good on you
It's something about the way you're smiling
Making the stars go round on you
I just gotta tell you baby
Tonight looks good on you

Tonight looks good on you
I just gotta tell you baby"
370,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Two Night Town,"I just spent three nights in a two night town
Sun's comin' up and I'm just goin' down
Am I ever gonna turn my life around
I just spend three nights in a two night town

It was women, it was sinnin', it was alcohol
It was everything the Bible says will make a man fall
And I didn't wanna little Lord I wanted it all
It was women, it was sinnin', it was alcohol

When am I, ever gonna learn to walk away
When the chips are down and the cards ain't fallin' my way
Why do I always gotta stay to long till it's too late

I just spend three nights in a two night town
With a bunch of lost souls just tryna get found
Girl, I've been a little crazy since you walked out
So I just spend three nights in a two night town

When am I ever gonna learn to walk away
When the chips are down and the cards ain't fallin' my way?
Why do I always gotta stay to long till it's too late?
I just spend three nights in a two night town

Sun's comin' up and I'm just goin' down
But baby this pain is still hangin around
I think I'll spend four nights in a two night town"
371,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Fast Lanes,"Not much for wearin' out my welcome
Always been that way and then some
Lonesome half the time
'Cause I need free and I need spacious
I get bothered, I get anxious just stoppin' at a red light
If I'm good at one thing, that's saying goodbye

I'm the reason they make fast lanes
My soul don't roll like no slow train
I hang my old hat in a new place
But it won't hang too long
Call me right or call me wrong
That's just my thing
I'm the reason they make fast lanes

When I left Georgia for the third time
I was closer to that state line than I ever was to her
Yeah, I could feel her fallin'
But somewhere down the road was callin'
And my wheels started to turn
It won't be the last time
And she ain't the first

I'm the reason they make fast lanes
My soul don't roll like no slow train
I hang my old hat in a new place
But it won't hang too long
Call me right or call me wrong
That's just my thing
I'm the reason they make fast lanes

I'm the reason they make fast lanes
My soul don't roll like no slow train
I hang my old hat in a new place
But it won't hang too long
Call me right or call me wrong
That's just my thing
I'm the reason they make fast lanes"
372,Jason Aldean,Country,6,I Break Everything I Touch,"If it's gonna happen, then it's gonna happen
That's just the way that it is
Oh love comes along and it don't take long
Till it slips through my fingertips
I could make some excuses, but darlin' the truth is
I'm just the reckless kind
And I don't wanna leave you to pick up the pieces
Oh no matter how I try

Girl, I break everything I touch
Little girl that's close enough
Seems like every heart I've ever loved
I break everything I touch

I can't look in your eyes and tell you a lie
I'd love to leave here with you
Oh but darlin' the fact is
I'm always atracted to everything I shouldn't do
Oh so you better know, before I lose control


Before we throw it all to chance
Girl your welcome to stay, but all I've got to say
Before you lay your heart in my hands

Yeah I break everything I touch
Little girl that's close enough
Seems like every heart I've ever loved
I break everything I touch

Well I break everything I touch
Little girl that's close enough
Seems like every heart I've ever loved
I break everything I touch

Yeah I break everything I touch
Little girl that's close enough
Seems like every heart I've ever loved
I break everything I touch"
373,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Crazy Town,"Roll into town step off the bus,
Shake off the where you came from dust,
Grab your guitar walk down the street, 
Sign says Nashville Tennessee,
But I have found 

It's a crazy town full of neon dreams, 
Everybody plays everybody sings, 
Hollywood with a touch of twang,
To be a star you gotta bang bang bang,
Bend those strings till the Hank comes out,
Make all the drunk girls scream and shout,
We love it we hate it we're all just trying to make it,
In this crazy town,

Pay your dues and you play for free,
And you pray for a honky tonk destiny,
You cut your teeth in the smokey bars,
And live off the tips from a pickle jar
Till find a cool new sound
And you smile when the record man shoots you down

It's a crazy town full of neon dreams, 
Everybody plays everybody sings, 
Hollywood with a touch of twang,
To be a star you gotta bang bang bang,
Bend those strings till the Hank comes out,
Make all the drunk girls scream and shout,
We love it we hate it we're all just trying to make it,
In this crazy town

One year they repossess your truck,
And the next you make a couple million bucks

It's a crazy town full of neon dreams, 
Everybody plays everybody sings, 
Hollywood with a touch of twang,
To be a star you gotta,
Bend those strings till the Hank comes out,
Make all the drunk girls scream and shout,
We love it we hate it we're all just trying to make it,
We love it we hate it we all came here to make it,
In this crazy town"
374,Jason Aldean,Country,6,No,"Looking back
At the dead ends and the detours
All I can do is long for a straighter line
Yeah, I was lost
I had no way of knowin'
Where the twists and turns were goin'
But sometimes you just gotta let the road wind

Could have been easier? Yeah.
A little smoother, right? Maybe so.
But lying here with you
Would I change one thing about that road?
No.

I believe
Things happen for a reason
Even though you might not see it at the time
Cause now I know
Every plan that came unraveled
Every crooked path I traveled in my life


Led me here to your side

Could it have been easier? Yeah.
A little smoother, right? Maybe so.
But lying here with you
Would I change one thing about that road?
No.

Yeah, I finally found you...

Could it have been easier? Yeah.
A little smoother, right? Maybe so.
But lying here with you
Would I change one thing bout that road?
It could have been easier, yeah
A little smoother right? maybe so
But lying here with you
Would I change one thing bout that road?
No."
375,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Just Gettin' Started,"I knew the minute that I picked you up
It was gonna be a wild ride
You kissed me like you couldn't get enough
Burning made it a U drive
Burning a little rubber at the red light
Got a little warning from the blue lights
It's only going 09 o'clock but feels more like midnight

We ain't even turned up the radio
Baby two miles down the road
The way you look at me baby I don't know
If we even gonna make it to the party
Yeah we gotta whole lot of moon light left
Already have the time of my live
And we're just getting started tonight

Girl you already got the wind down
And you got your seat laid back
I ain't even make it halfway to town
And you already talking about a 6 pack
Already got your shoes off
And you talking about slippin' off
No we ain't even found your friends saying
You already wanna get lost

We ain't even turned up the radio
Baby two miles down the road
The way you look at me baby I don't know
If we even gonna make it to the party
Yeah we gotta whole lot of moon light left
Already have the time of my live
And we're just getting started tonight

Ain't had a drink and I'm torn up
Ain't even had a taste of your love
But girl the crazy thing is
We're just getting warmed up

We ain't even turned up the radio
Baby two miles down the road
The way you look at me baby I don't know
If we even gonna make it to the party
Yeah we gotta whole lot of moon light left
Already have the time of my live
And we're just getting started tonight"
376,Jason Aldean,Country,6,I Don't Do Lonely Well,"Baby since you've been gone
I leave the TV on
Gotta hear somebody's voice
I just need some kind of noise
I lay some pillows down
To wrap my arms around
I pretend I'm holding you
I know it's sad but it's what I do
To keep me from goin' crazy

I can get up and face the day
Just fine all by myself
Go out and take on the world
And get it done like nobody else
Oh but I don't do lonely well

I got some real good friends
Check on me now and then
Try to get me out at night
Say I need to get a life
It's easy to say all right
When you're not the one goin' crazy

I can get up and face the day
Just fine all by myself
Go out and take on the world
And get it done like nobody else
Oh but I don't do lonely well

Here comes another sunset
Here comes another long night
I'm not over you yet
No I'm not over you yet

I can get up and face the day
Just fine all by myself
Go out and take on the world
Get it done like nobody else
Oh but I don't do, don't do lonely well
No no no
Don't do lonely well"
377,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Who's Kissing You Tonight,"I don't think of you every day and night
I got things to do, yeah I'm doing all right
So, I can't explain why in times like these
I nearly go insane when you're not here with me
Oh I know it's really over and you're never coming back
And there's no way that I can make it right
Still I wonder, oh I wonder, oh baby I can't but wonder
Who's kissing you tonight?

Oh it's the jealousy that's hurting me
So why can't I let it be, why can't I just let go?
But the thought of you somewhere with someone else


Doing what we used to do, feeling what we felt
Oh I know it's really over and you're never coming back
And there's no way that I can make it right
Still I wonder, oh I wonder, oh baby I can't but wonder
Who's kissing you tonight?

Oh I know it's really over and you're never coming back
And there's no way that I can make it right
Still I wonder, oh I wonder, oh baby I can't but wonder
Who's kissing you... Who's kissing tonight?
Who's holding you tight? Aw, Who's kissing you tonight?"
378,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Tattoos on This Town,"There's still black marks on that county road
Where we drag raced our pickups and mustangs
And weathered all the sun and rain

And to this day up on that overpass
Even underneath the new paint, you can still see
Allie will you marry me

Take a ride, look around
There ain't no doubt

It sure left its mark on us, we sure left our mark on it
We let the world know we were here with everything we did
We laid a lot of memories down like tattoos on this town

There's still a rope burn on that oak branch
That hangs over the river, I still got the scar
From swinging out a little too far

There ain't a corner of this hallowed ground
That we ain't laughed or cried on
It's where we loved, lived and learned real life stuff
It's everything we're made of

It sure left its mark on us, we sure left our mark on it
We let the world know we were here with everything we did
We laid a lot of memories down like tattoos on this town
Like tattoos on this town

Everywhere, there we are
It hits me right in my heart

It sure left its mark on us, we sure left our mark on it
We let the world know we were here with everything we did
We laid a lot of memories down

And we'll always be hanging around like tattoos on this town
Like tattoos on this town"
379,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Bad,"When you're good, girl you're good
Doing every little thing exactly like you should
So sweet, with your angel eyes just killin' me
On the porch, blue sky
Yeah you hold my hand say you want to take a Sunday drive
It's all good, when you're good

But when you're bad
And you're lookin' at me just like that
Reach up and you take my hat and you turn it around
Steal my drink and you shoot it on down
When you're wild, child, flashin' that come here smile
Spinnin' in your little red dress
Show a little too much
When you dance like that
Sayin' look don't touch
I never know what I'll get when we get together
When you're good, you're good
But when you're bad, you're better

When you're good, girl you're good
When you're countin' the stars in the sky layin' back
On the hood, talkin' 'bout
How you want to stay here 'til the moon goes out
With your head, on my chest
One innocent little kiss
Aw it's so good, so good, when you're good

When you're bad
And you're lookin' at me just like that
Reach up and you take my hat and you turn it around

All the day and the nighttime too
But you're the best I've ever had

When you're bad

380,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Dirt Road Anthem,"Yeah, I'm chilling on a dirt road
Laid back swerving like I'm George Jones
Smoke rolling out the window
An ice-cold beer sitting in the console

Memory lane up in the headlights
Has got me reminiscing on them good times
I'm turning off a real live drive and that's right
I'm hitting easy street on mud tires, let's ride

Back in the day Pott's farm was the place to go
Load the truck up, hit the dirt road
Jump the barbed wire, spread the word
Light the bonfire then call the girls

King in the can and the Marlboro Man
Jack 'n' Jim were a few good men
Where you learned how to kiss and cuss, and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue

And all this small town he said, she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something y'all don't know
Man, that talk is getting old

You better mind your business man, watch your mouth
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out
I'm tired of talking, man, y'all ain't listening
Them ol' dirt roads is what y'all missing

Yeah, I'm chilling on a dirt road
Laid back, swerving like I'm George Jones
Smoke rolling out the window
An ice-cold beer sitting in the console

Memory lane up in the headlights
Has got me reminiscing on them good times
I'm turning off a real live drive and that's right
I'm hitting easy street on mud tires, let's ride

I sit back and think about them good ol' days
The way we were raised in our southern ways
And we like cornbread and biscuits
And if it's broke 'round here, we fix it

I can take y'all where you need to go
Down to my hood, back in them woods
We do it different 'round here, that's right
But we sure do it good, and we do it all night

So if you really want to know how it feels
To get off the road with trucks and four wheels
Jump on in and, man, tell your friends
We'll raise some hell where the blacktop ends

I'm chilling on a dirt road
Laid back, swerving like I'm George Jones
Smoke rolling out the window
An ice-cold beer sitting in the console

Memory lane up in the headlights
Has got me reminiscing on them good times
I'm turning off a real live drive and that's right
I'm hitting easy street on mud tires, let's ride

I'm chilling on a dirt road

384,Jason Aldean,Country,6,I Took It With Me,"When I passed that city limits sign
I knew that I was finally on my own
So I put my foot down on the gas
To see how fast those wheels could get me gone
Everything about that place made me who I am
They say once you leave
You can't go back again

So I took it with me
That cloud of red dust rollin' up
That Georgia blue sky settin' sun
Straight up Highway 41
I took it with me
That wild streak
That fightin' side
That born to run on Friday night
That standing tall small town pride
I took it with me

Well they say this world can change you fast
Kick you right on back where you belong
So I roll my sleeves up everyday
And that's just what you do where I come from
Everything I ever knew I bottled up inside
When I need a shot of back home
It ain't hard to find

So I took it with me
That cloud of red dust rollin' up
That Georgia blue sky settin' sun
Straight up Highway 41
I took it with me
That wild streak
That fightin' side
That born to run on Friday night
That standing tall small town pride
I took it with me

I might be a thousand miles away
But it's still crystal clear
I see that picture in my mind
And I keep it right here

'Cause I took it with me
That cloud of red dust rollin' up
That Georgia blue sky settin' sun
Straight up Highway 41
I took it with me
That wild streak
That fightin' side
That born to run on Friday night
That standing tall small town pride

Oh, I took it with me"
385,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Black Tears,"She puts on her work clothes, fishnet pantyhose,
She's got a nickname everybody knows at the gentlemen's club
She clocks in at midnight, even though it never feels right,
Makes her money one dollar at a time.
Without the makeup, nobody knows her name,
And she wears the pain

Black tears, rolling down,
From the eyes of an angel in a sinner's town
She reveals, and they all cheer,
Then she cries, black tears

Jealous of the innocent, sometimes she's convinced,
The boss man is still a friend she needs.
She's tried everything, cheap sex and cocaine,
Anything to hide the pain for a little while
The wrong kind of famous in her momma's eyes,
You can tell she knows it when she cries

Black tears, rolling down
From the eyes of an angel in a sinner's town,
White lights on the mirror,
Just won't hide, black tears

She tries and tries so hard to get away
But everybody's watching

Black tears, rolling down,
From the eyes of an angel in a sinner's town,
If all the pain would just disappear
She'd quit cryin', yeah she'd quit cryin',
Black tears"

You start thinking this is more than what it really is
You're beginning to dream and maybe someday
You could be the angel that could make me change
But all I see is a storm that you'll get lost in
'Cause if it feels this good when we're just talkin'

You should be walking away, walking away
As far as you can go, as fast as you can.
You don't know it but you oughta be walking away, walking away
From me baby
Instead of tryin' to save me
You oughta be walking away

You're standing there, in your party dress
And there ain't no doubt about it darlin' I'm impressed
But I see you and I know me.
I'd say right now that I'm the last thing that you need
But girl don't get me wrong, I'd sure love to do this
But somewhere in my heart I know the truth is

You ought to be walking away, walking away
As far as you can go, as fast as you can.
You don't know it but you oughta be walking away, walking away
From me baby

I was waitin' 'round the block 'cause your daddy would have killed me if he'd a seen me
You jumped in my ride, we made a beeline out of town
And I drove so fast, yeah I drove so fast

We were rollin' down an open road
With the top laid back and the stars all shining
Headed down to Mexico you were kissing my neck, yeah you had me flying
Rockin' to the radio, you in that short crop tank top dressed to kill
One hand on you, one on the wheel
Yeah, that's the way a night should feel
That's the way a night should feel

That was such a long time ago yeah I'll never know how we made it
You're still that same wild child and I don't take your love for granted
So let's jump in my ride, make a beeline out of town
And do it all again yeah like back when

We were rollin' down an open road

Headed down to Mexico you were kissing my neck, yeah you had me flying
Rockin' to the radio, you in that short crop tank top dressed to kill
One hand on you, one on the wheel

The way a night should feel

When you're all about me and I'm all about you
Baby right now all I want to do, let's go

Rollin' down an open road
With the top laid back and the stars all shining
Headed down to Mexico, keep kissing my neck 'cause it keeps me flying

The kind that just wants to change me
Likes to find all my flaws
Thought I had you figured out
I told myself she's crazy
Man, was I ever wrong
The whole time you were just trying to love me

I pushed and you pulled
Should have just fell into you
But I did what I always do, I always do
Wanted to talk but I walked away
Didn't want to hear what you had to say
Stupid me, can't believe I never knew
The whole time you were just trying to love me

Didn't think those tears were real
Thought you were just trying to play me
I just stood there and let 'em fall
You were just loving me after all

I pushed and you pulled
Should have just fell into you
But I did what I always do, I always do
Wanted to talk but I walked away
Didn't want to hear what you had to say
Stupid me, can't believe I never knew
The whole time you were just trying to love me

Wanted to talk but I walked away
Didn't want to hear what you had to say
Stupid me, I can't believe I never knew, I never knew
The whole time you were just trying

To love me
Trying to love me"
390,Jason Aldean,Country,6,The Best of Me,"I found a box of memories
Read a letter dropped a tear where you signed your name
And turnin' the page smearing the ink and the love always
Girl I always start this way
Then I end up in a bottle screaming out your name
And punching the walls, carrying on like I've gone insane
In the mirror I can see the man that just shook his head with no remorse
Watched an angel crying tears packing all her things as she walked out the door

Cause there ain't nothing like a memory
When it's coming on strong like a hurricane
How can love like that just up and walk away
It's killing me baby
It's got me pouring up another drink
Bourbons hittin me hard like a freight train
With my back against a wall or on my knees
When the worst of your memory gets the best of me

I remember it all too well
Riding 441 down to Milledgeville
Crossing the bridge as the sun set on lake St. Claire
I couldn't wait to see your smile but all I saw was tears in your pretty eyes
That said it all, it was all down hill from there
And I remember you saying baby please don't give up on me
All but baby this stubborn man is gonna line the bed he made

Cause there ain't nothing like a memory
When it's coming on strong like a hurricane
How can love like that just up and walk away
It's killing me baby
It's got me pouring up another drink
Bourbons hittin me hard like a freight train
With my back against a wall or on my knees
When the worst of your memory gets the best of me

Cause there ain't nothing like a memory
When it's coming on strong like a hurricane
How can love like that just up and walk away
It's killing me baby
It's got me pouring up another drink
Bourbons hittin me hard like a freight train
With my back against a wall or on my knees
When the worst of your memory gets the best of me"
391,Jason Aldean,Country,6,My Memory Ain't What It Used to Be,"It must have been a mountain standing in our way
Or some small misunderstanding
We talked about too late
Was it the kitchen or the bedroom
Where we let a good thing go
Was it destined dreams, or space we needed?
I don't know.

Baby, lately my memory
Ain't what it used to be at all
It's crazy, but holding you close to me
Seeing you smile at me
Is all that I recall
'Cause baby it don't matter how hard I try
I still can't remember why we said goodbye

Maybe time's just playing tricks on me these days
Or maybe these old feelings never went away
'Cause all that I remember
Is that I'm still in love with you

And if I'm losing my mind, I hope you are too

Baby, lately my memory
Ain't what it used to be at all
It's crazy, but holding you close to me
Seeing you smile at me
Is all that I recall
'Cause baby it don't matter how hard I try
I still can't remember why we said goodbye
Goodbye

It's crazy
But holding you close to me
Seeing you smile at me
Is all that I recall
'Cause baby, it don't matter how hard I try
I still can't remember why we said goodbye
Why we said goodbye
Why did we say goodbye?"
392,Jason Aldean,Country,6,I Ain't Ready to Quit,"There's something about lightnin up a marlboro red
That nicotine rush into my head
And a taste of southern comfort on my lips
Tells me I ain't ready to quit

Something about driving way to fast
Switchin gears and hammerin on the gas
And the fact that they ain't called me yet
Tells me I ain't ready to quit

Don't start thinking I'm gonna stop
Giving it all I got
If you think you seen love you ain't seen nothing yet
How could I ever get tired
Of wakin' up by your side
And the taste of your sweet kiss
Tells me I ain't ready to quit

There's something about the way you say my name
That drives this old country boy insane
So baby don't don't stop loving me like this

'Cause I ain't ready to quit

Don't start thinking I'm gonna stop
Giving it all I got
If you think you seen love you ain't seen nothing yet
How could I ever get tired
Of waking up by your side
And the taste of your sweet kiss
Tells me I ain't ready to quit

Don't start thinking I'm gonna stop
Girl I'm giving it all I got
If you think you seen love you ain't seen nothing yet
How could I ever get tired
Of wakin' up by your side
And the taste of your sweet kiss
And the taste of your sweet kiss
Tells me I ain't ready to quit"
393,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Texas Was You,"Ohio was a riverbank
A ten speed laying in the weeds
Cannonball off an old rope swing
Long, long summer days

Tennessee was a guitar
First big dream of mine
If I made it, yeah, that'd be just fine
I just wanted to play, I just wanted to play

But Texas was green eyes crying goodbye
Was a long drive, a heartache
I'm still trying to get through
Texas was you

Carolina was a black car
A big white number three
California was a yellow Jeep
Cruising down Big Sur, ha, ha

Georgia was a summer job
And Bama was a spring break
I got memories all over the place
But only one still hurts, only one still hurts

Like Texas was green eyes crying goodbye
Was a long drive, a heartache
I'm still trying to get through
Texas was you

Texas was my whole life waving goodbye
Thought I'd die, a heartache
I'm still trying to get through

But Texas was you
It'll always be you"
394,Jason Aldean,Country,6,I Believe in Ghosts,"I've never been superstitious
I've never feared the unknown
But ever since you left me
I've believed in ghosts
Girl, I believe in ghosts

Well I'm haunted by a memory
That won't leave or let me go
Call me crazy and I may be
But I believe in ghosts
Girl, I believe in ghosts

I swear I keep seeing shadows
I know that I'm not alone
I feel the temperature dropping
And it chills me to the bone

Well I'm haunted by a memory
That won't leave or let me go
Call me crazy and I may be
But I believe in ghosts
Girl, I believe in ghosts

Should I be afraid, should I be scared
You follow me everywhere, I'm haunted

Call me crazy hell I may be
But I believe in ghosts

Well I'm haunted by a memory
That won't leave or let me go
Call me crazy and I may be
But I believe in ghosts
Girl, I believe in ghosts

I've never been superstitious
I've never feared the unknown
But ever since you left me baby
I've believed in ghosts"
395,Jason Aldean,Country,6,This I Gotta See,"I can't count the barns I've past,
Painted red, white and black,
See rock city,
And up ahead there's a turn,
Take me right through Gatlinberg,
I hear it's pretty,

Maybe some other time,
I can't slow down,
Right across that state line,
Right about now,

Her hairs still wet from her bath,
She's sitting on her front porch with a glass,
Of iced tea,
In my sweat shirt,
And her bare feet,
This I gotta see,
If I hurry I can catch,
The colors on her skin from that sunset,
And her face,
And that love waiting on me,
This I gotta see,
This I gotta see,

I can't wait to get to her,
Man I wish I were,
There already,
She's the only thing that keeps,
This world from driving me,
Crazy,

I just hit that city limit,
Yeah and that a pretty good sign,
If I pick It Up a bit,
I'll be right on time,"
396,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Big Green Tractor,"She had a shiny little beamer with the rag top down
Sitting in the drive but she wouldn't get out
The dogs were all barking and a wagging around
I just laughed and said y'all get in
She had on a new dress and she curled her hair
She was looking too good not to go somewhere
I said whatcha wanna do baby I don't care
We can go to the show or we can stay right here and

I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you it don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

I said we can fire it up and I can show you around
Sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down
When the fire flies are dancing and the moon comes out
We can turn on the lights and head back to the house or

We can take another ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

Mmm just let me dust off the seat
Mmm now put your pretty little arms around me

Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you've got me to hold on to
We can go to town but baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor
We can go to town
Or we can go another round
On my big green tractor"
397,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Too Much You for Me,"Funny thing about a small town
Your life goes by as you're drivin' out
The house you were livin' in the barn that we did it in
Girl I just wanna forget it now
Never thought a couple headlights would light up a town so bright
Our names a little faded in the saddle we painted makes me baby wanna turn around

Hey this town is too much you for me
I can't live around all these memories
I see you everywhere I look it's somethin' I don't wanna see
Girl this town is too much you for me

Just passed X of 25 we used to slip out there
Friday night watchin' the sun go down with the radio loud
Drownin' out the sound of being turned on
I thought those days would never end
But lookin' back now they sure did
I was still livin' it every night every minute
And girl I swear I gotta move on

Hey this town is too much you for me
I can't live around all these memories
I see you everywhere I look it's somethin' I don't wanna see
Girl this town is too much you for me

Hey this town is too much you for me
I can't live around all these memories
I see you everywhere I look it's somethin' I don't wanna see
Girl this town is too much you for me

Is too much you for me"
398,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Lights Come On,"You're a crack-of-dawn, Monday-morning, coffee strong
Poured everything you got into a paycheck Friday night
You're a Powerstroke diesel, backhoe-riding king of beers, 18-wheeler
Driving, living life in between the lines
Of clocking in and quitting time

But then the six-string circus comes to town
We hang them speakers over the crowd

When the lights come on, everybody's screaming
Lighters in the sky, yeah, everybody's singing
Every word to every song to a girl to take it home tonight
When the lights come on, everybody's feeling
A hallelujah high from the floor to the ceiling
Yeah, the drink that we're drinking, the smoke that we're smoking
The party we throw, it's going all night long
When the lights come on
When the lights come on

You're a little shy thing with a wild side
On a night like this, you just can't hide
'Cause it's time to live it up
So come on and raise your cup

If we're talkin' 'bout memories, yeah, we're gonna make 'em
Talkin' 'bout rules, you know we're gonna break 'em

When the lights come on, everybody's screaming
Lighters in the sky, yeah, everybody's singing
Every word to every song to a girl to take it home tonight

Yeah, we all the same 'cause we thinkin' the same thing
We on the same page 'cause we sippin' the same drink
Here's a little something to thank y'all for showing up
Aldean and the boys about to blow it up, haha

When the lights come on, everybody's screaming
Lighters in the sky, yeah, everybody's singing
Every word to every song to a girl to take it home tonight

400,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Love Was Easy,"It seems like money, 
Is always on our minds these days,
Make more spend more, 
Worry how the bills will get paid,
Oh it wasn't that long ago, 
But it seems so far away,
When we didn't have a damn thing,
But we were happy,

And love was easy,
Just laying on a river bank all night counting the stars,
Love was easy,
As that feeling we found in the back seat of my car,
Even in the dark,
Love was easy,
When we didn't make it so hard,

Can you tell me,
The last time we really laughed,
The last time we had a moment,
When we hated that the moment passed,
Here we are down the road,
Standing here looking back,
Seeing what we used to have,
Is what we're missing,

When love was easy,
Just laying on a river bank all night counting the stars,
Love was easy,
As that feeling we found in the back seat of my car,
Even in the dark,
Love was easy,
When we didn't make it so hard,

Maybe that's how it is,
Ah maybe that's how it goes,
But all I know,

Is love was easy,
Just laying on a river bank all night counting the stars,
Love was easy,
As that feeling we found in the back seat of my car,
Even in the dark,
Love was easy,
When we didn't make it so hard,
When we didn't make it so hard,
Love was easy baby yeah,"
401,Jason Aldean,Country,6,If My Truck Could Talk,"Twelve gauge '04 buckshot floorboard, don't ask
Fence post, door dent, let's just leave it at that
It's got dirt on me, yeah I'd be up a creek

If my truck could talk, I'd have to yank out all the wires
Pour on the gas, set it on fire, anything to shut it up
It's been good to me, but it knows too much, it's seen it all
I'd have to find a riverbank and roll it off
If my truck could talk

Those two headlights looked in her eyes, while she danced
Moonlit truck bed, two kids, enough said, yeah man
All that went on, those all night longs
It could go on and on and on

If my truck could talk, I'd have to yank out all the wires
Pour on the gas, set it on fire, anything to shut it up
It's been good to me, but it knows too much, it's seen it all
I'd have to find a riverbank and roll it off
If my truck could talk

If my truck could talk, I couldn't deny a word it said
I'd just smile and shake my head, yeah

It's been good to me, but it knows too much, it's seen it all
I'd have to find a riverbank and roll it off
If my truck could talk, if my truck could talk
If my truck could talk"
402,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Back in This Cigarette,"It's 2 A.M. in my new home, this motel room
An ashtray full of Lucky Strikes
A half spent case of warm Bud Light
Counting regrets, fighting back tears
Retracin' steps, gettin' nowhere

Callin' your name, it's a waste of my breath
There's no reachin' you across this cold and empty bed
Stirrin' up ashes, tryin' to find passion where there's no love left
It's like tryin' to put smoke back in this cigarette

Come sunrise, guess I'll check out and ditch this town
Put a few more miles between us
And keep drivin' till I finally mend my broken trust
Hangin' my hopes on highway signs
If I lie here, I'll lose my mind

Callin' your name, it's a waste of my breath
There's no reachin' you across this cold and empty bed
Stirrin' up ashes, tryin' to find passion where there's no love left
It's like tryin' to put smoke back in this cigarette

I may never know your reasons why
But someday I'm gonna see the good in your goodbye

Callin' your name, it's a waste of my breath
There's no reachin' you across this empty bed
Stirrin' up ashes, tryin' to find passion where there's no love left
It's like tryin' to put smoke back in this cigarette"
403,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Too Fast,"I want to be the man that you thought I was
I want to be the man that made you fall in love
I can't undo everything I've done
But let me tell you right now
Baby, you're the only one

I don't want to be a restless soul
Runnin' on empty, burnin' up the road
Never knowin' what I'm tryin' to find
While the wheels keep turnin' in the back of my mind
I don't wanna take a long way home
Sleepin' in a roadside room alone
Head in the clouds, foot on the gas, livin' my life too fast

I've been makin' a livin', not makin' a life
And knowin' that now, well it cuts like a knife
The way it's been ain't how it's gonna be
Baby, startin' right now, gonna give you the best of me

I don't want to be a restless soul
Runnin' on empty, burnin' up the road
Never knowin' what I'm tryin' to find
While the wheels keep turnin' in the back of my mind
I don't wanna take a long way home
Sleepin' in a roadside room alone
Head in the clouds, foot on the gas, livin' my life too fast

Ooh, I've been a rollin' stone
I think it's time for me to roll on home

I don't want to be a restless soul
Runnin' on empty, burnin' up the road
Never knowin' what I'm tryin' to find
While the wheels keep turnin' in the back of my mind
I don't want to take the long way home
Sleepin' in a roadside room alone

Livin' my life too fast"
404,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Water Tower,"State champs white and blue
Yeah, I remember you
You sure had a hell of a view from way up there
High above the yellow pines
And first baptist ""Jesus Saves"" sign
I talked to you a million times but
I'm getting out of hand

Water tower, it sure is good to see you,
I've been away, for way too long
Water tower like a lighthouse in a storm,
You help me find my way back home

How far did you think I'd get
When I pointed my wheels out west?
A little young and dumb I guess
Gotta learn somehow
Slowin' down and drivin' in
I can finally breathe again
It's like I found a long lost friend
God I've missed this town

Water tower, it sure is good to see you,
I've been away, way too long
Water tower like a lighthouse in a storm,
You help me find my way back home

You and that lonesome full moon watching over me
I'm right where I'm supposed to be

Water tower, it sure is good to see you,
I've been away, way too long

You help me find my way back home
You help me find my way"

And that I'm probably doing fine,

Blowin' every dollar I ever made,
Tell 'em that I must be into something bad for me cause,
I sure lost a lot of weight,
Tell 'em I'm out on the road with some old rock and roll band,
Living like a gypsy can,

The truth is that I'm asking you to lie,
And we both know that it ain't right,
But if you ever loved me please,
Have some mercy on me,

409,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Fly over States,"Couple guys in first class on a flight from New York to Los Angeles 
Kinda making small talk, killin' time, flirtin' with the flight attendants 
Thirty thousand feet above what would be Oklahoma 

Just a bunch of square corn fields and wheat farms, man it all looks the same 
Miles and miles of back roads and highways connecting little towns with funny names 
Who'd wanna live down there, in the middle of nowhere 

They've never drove through Indiana 
Met the man who plowed that Earth 
Planted that seed, busted his ass for you and me 
Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas 
They'd understand why God made those fly over states 

I bet that mile haul in Santa Fe freight train engineer's seen it all 
Just like that flat bed cowboy stacking U.S. steel on a three day haul 
Roads and rails under their feet, yeah that sounds like a first class seat 

On the plains of Oklahoma 
With a windshield sunset in your eyes 

Like a watercolor painted sky 
You'll think heaven's doors have opened 
You'll understand why God made those fly over states 

Take a ride across the Badlands 
Feel that freedom on your face 
Breathe in all that open space 
And meet a girl from Amarillo

You'll understand why God made... 
You might even wanna plant your stakes 
In those fly over states 
Yeah 

Have you ever been through Indiana 
On the plains of Oklahoma 
Take a ride"
410,Jason Aldean,Country,6,Take a Little Ride,"Been goin' 'round and 'round all day
Bailin' some hay and stacking it all up

Shine the old truck up
Swing by the quick stop
Grab a little shiner bock
Then ease on out your way
To your place around eight o'clock

Well I'm just ready to ride this Chevy,
Ride this Chevy down a little back road
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, turn up the radio

Put your pretty pink toes on the dash
Lean your seat back
Man I swear there ain't nothing looks better than that
Sweet tan, little thing with nothing to do
I wanna take a little ride with you

I hope you're wearing those frayed out cut-offs
Makes me want to get lost down in the moonlight
Drop the tailgate down on a turn road
Watch the corn grow, baby that's a good night
Anyone from the Heartland is gonna understand
What I'm talking about right now
Ain't no doubt, we got a game plan

Well I'm just ready to ride this Chevy,
Ride this Chevy down a little back road
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, turn up the radio

And I'm right on the middle mark
I'm just in the tier of everything that rides below the surface
And I watch from a distance seventeen
And I'm short of the others dreams of being golden and on top
It's not what you painted in my head
There's so much there instead of all the colors that I saw

Oh the prettiest of lights that hang the hallways of the home
And the cries from the strangers out at night
They don't keep us up at night
We have the curtains drawn and closed

We all are living in a dream,

Oh everything's a mess
And all these sorrows I have seen
They lead me to believe
That everything's a mess

But I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream

I know all your reasons
To keep me from seeing
Everything is actually a mess
But now I am leaving
All of us were only dreaming
Everything is actually a mess

I've seen the glitz, I've seen the glam
But I prefer the pay dirt

I took a photograph of me
When I was only nineteen
I looked a little lost at sea
I keep trying to find me

Pray for me brother
I need redemption
I'm just a man
A man on a mission
I want no trouble
I want no trouble
I want no trouble
I want no trouble
Pray for me sister
Give me a mention
I got no faith
And oh did I mention
I want no trouble
I want no trouble
I want no trouble
I want no trouble

Maybe you could save my soul
From all the things that I don't know
Maybe you could save my soul
From all the things that I don't know

Is there nothing good in me

Petty lies to everyone
In the hopes that I could be someone
Heaven talks but not to me
And now I wonder if it's meant to be
Desolation tragedy
Is there nothing good in me
I've let me down, down, down, down

But I'll take your word
'Cause after all you've never lied
Oh not at all

Oh what a mess
I get caught up in the things that matter the least
Oh let me have release
I've let me down, down, down, down"

I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes, to ashes

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am"
489,Imagine Dragons,Alternative,20,Amsterdam (iTunes Session),"I'm sorry, mother... I'm sorry, I let you down.

Well, these days I'm fine - No these days I tend to lie.

I'll take the West train, just by the side of Amsterdam,

Just by my left brain, just by the side of the tin-man.

I'm sorry, brother... I'm sorry, I let you down.

Well, these days you're fine - No these days you tend to lie.

You'll take the West train, just by the side of Amsterdam,

Just by your left brain, just by the side of the tin-man.

Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it,

It's hard, believe me... I've tried.

But I keep coming up short.

I'm sorry lover, I'm sorry I bring you down.

Well, these days I've tried and these days I tend to lie.

Kinda thought I was a mystery and then I thought it wasn't meant to be,

You said yourself fantastically, ""Congratulations you were all alone"".

Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it,

It's hard, believe me... I've tried.

Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it,

It's hard, believe me... I've tried.

But the rain won't fall for the both of us,

And sun won't shine on the both of us.

Believe me when I say, that I wouldn't have it any other way.

Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it,

It's hard, believe me... I've tried.

But I won't wait much longer, cause these wall start crashing down.

Oh I won't wait much longer, cause these wall start crashing down.

And I keep coming up shore..."

When you said that you were spent?
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a raincheck

I don't ever want to let you down
I don't ever want to leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turning to rags and giving the commodities a raincheck

I don't ever want to let you down
I don't ever want to leave this town

491,Imagine Dragons,Alternative,20,Gold (Jorgen Odegard Remix),"First comes the blessing of all that you've dreamed
But then comes the curses of diamonds and rings
Only at first did it have its appeal
But now you can't tell the false from the real
Who can you trust, who you can you trust?

When everything, everything, everything you
Touch turns to gold, gold, gold
Everything, everything, everything you touch
Turns to gold, gold, gold, gold, gold, gold

Statues and empires are all at your hands
Water to wine and the finest of sands
When all that you have is turning stale and it's cold
Oh you no longer feel when your heart's turned to gold
Who can you trust, who can you trust?

When everything, everything, everything you
Touch turns to gold, gold, gold
Everything, everything, everything you touch
Turns to gold, gold, gold, gold, gold, gold

I'm dying to feel again
Oh anything at all
But oh I feel nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

When everything, everything, everything you
Touch turns to gold, gold, gold
Everything, everything, everything you touch
Turns to gold, gold, gold, gold, gold, gold"
492,Imagine Dragons,Alternative,20,Destination (iTunes Session),"I see the colors of the world and they're arranging
The center sentinels are cunningly estranging all
I think a little about a lot I'm introverted
You think a lot about a little never heard it
All of our energy
I bring these words to life

We stay up late and draw the lines to every constellation
We live with all our sorrows tied to age and separation
These are the days of love and life
These are our expectations
We stay up late to live tonight
This is our destination

Take me back to ninety one
I had a love life there, it's a loaded gun alright
I see the colours of the world they're rearranging
The center sentinels are leaving but are changing
All of our energy
Bring these words to life

We stay up late and draw the lines to every constellation
We live with all our sorrows tied to age and separation
These are the days of love and life
These are our expectations
We stay up late to live tonight

Am I out of touch?
Am I out of my place?

I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong

Oh I'm going to mess this up
Oh this is just my luck
Over and over and over again

I'm sorry for everything
Oh everything I've done
From the second that I was born
It seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through
Everything I loved
Oh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single
Thing that I loved

Am I out of luck?
Am I waiting to break?
When I keep saying that I'm looking for a
Way to escape
Oh I'm wishing I had what I'd taken for granted
I can't help you when I'm only gonna do
You wrong

At the roadside that
We used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away
At the bayside
Where you used to show
In the moonlight
Where we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away

And there's always time to change your mind
Oh there's always time to change your mind
Oh love, can you hear me
Oh let it drift away

I'm sorry for everything
Oh everything I've done
From the second that I was born
It seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through
Everything I loved
Oh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single
Thing that I loved

It's been a while since we have talked
You have grown
Your eyes are older than the tallest tree you see
Thirty lives can be extraordinarily long

Lay me down
Lay me down
Again my friend
I know it's been a while since I could look you in the eyes
'Cause I am foolish and I am sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright
Alright

Good morning myself
It's been a while since we have talked
You have changed
For better or worse is yet to determine
But I am sure
That you'll keep living and breathing until this world turns over

But lay me down
Lay me down
Again my friend
I know it's been a while since I could look you in the eyes
'Cause I am foolish and I'm sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright

I'mma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh

Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I can be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Write down my poems for the few
Who looked at me took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Take up my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the

Pain
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my god, they came from
Pain
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

I was choking in the crowd
Living my brain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke up and it rained down
It rained down, like

Pain
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain
You break me down, you built me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my god, they came from
Pain
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh

But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke up and it rained down
You rained down, like

Pain
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain
You break me down, you built me up, believer, believer
Pain
I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my god, they came from
Pain
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer"
